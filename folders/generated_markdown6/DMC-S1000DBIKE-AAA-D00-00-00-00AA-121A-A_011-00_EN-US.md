## Procedure Steps
### Step 1: Examine the Brakes
1. Examine the condition of the brakes.
2. Open the brake quick release.
3. Examine the condition and thickness of the brake pads.
	* Make sure there is a large quantity of rubber left.
	* Make sure the pad is not too hard.
4. Clean all unwanted material.

### Step 2: Inspect Brake Installation
1. Do an inspection of the installation of the brakes.
2. Check the hydraulic brake system function.
	+ Refer to [Hydraulic brake function](#hydraulic-brake-function) for more information.
3. Make sure there is sufficient clearance between the pad and the inner diameter of the brake surface.
4. **Caution:** If the position of the pads is too low on the rim, the pads can move, causing separation of the spokes from their mountings.
	+ Refer to [Brake pad seating](#brake-pad-seating) for more information.

### Step 3: Check Tire Pressure
1. Do a check of the tire pressure using the [Tire pressure gauge](#tire-pressure-gauge).
2. Compare the value read with the recommended pressure shown on the sidewall of the tire.
3. Add necessary air.

### Step 4: Examine Wheels
1. Examine the condition of the wheels.
2. Examine the rims for bulges and dents.
3. Examine for splits at the seam where an extruded rim is bonded.

### Step 5: Check Headset Bearings
1. Straddle the bicycle.
2. Apply the front brakes and push the handlebars forward.
3. Make sure the headset bearings are tight.

### Step 6: Check Chain
1. Visually examine the chain.
2. If the chain is too dirty, clean it as specified in the [Clean chain task](#clean-chain-task).
3. Visually examine the chain for links that are frozen or do not move easily.
4. Apply necessary lubricant.
5. Do a check of the chain to make sure it is tight.
	* Make sure the play of the chain is not too much.
