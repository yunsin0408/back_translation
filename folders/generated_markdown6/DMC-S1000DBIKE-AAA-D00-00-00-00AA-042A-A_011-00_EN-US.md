## Introduction to Bicycles
A bicycle, also called a bike or cycle, is a human-powered, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other.

## Components of a Bicycle
### Frame and Fork
The frame and fork are the main structural components of a bicycle. The frame provides the base structure for attaching various components, while the fork holds the front wheel.

### Wheels and Tires
Bicycles have two wheels, with the front wheel being steered by the handlebars. Tires provide traction and cushioning between the wheel and the ground.

### Braking System
The braking system allows riders to slow down or stop their bicycles. It typically consists of brake levers, cables, calipers, and brake pads.

### Gearing System
The gearing system enables cyclists to adjust the difficulty of pedaling based on terrain conditions. This includes components such as chain rings, sprockets, derailleurs, and shifters.

## Bicycle History
The history of bicycles dates back to 1817 when German Baron Karl von Drais invented the first two-wheeled, human-powered vehicle. Over the years, significant innovations have transformed the bicycle into its modern forms, including the introduction of pedals, chains, pneumatic tires, and derailleur gears.
