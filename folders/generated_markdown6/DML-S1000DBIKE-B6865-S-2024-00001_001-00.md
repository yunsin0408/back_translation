DML Content
================

The provided XML data contains a collection of DML (Digital Maintenance Library) entries. Here's an overview of the content:

### DML Entries

There are multiple DML entries in the dataset, each containing information about a specific component or system of a vehicle. The entries include details such as:

* **Model Code**: `S1000DBIKE`
* **System Code**: varies (e.g., `DA4`, `DA5`)
* **Subsystem Code**: varies (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`)
* **Info Code**: varies (e.g., `041`, `251`)
* **Tech Name**: varies (e.g., `Chain`, `Hubs`, `Shifters`)
* **Info Name**: varies (e.g., `Description of how it is made`, `Clean with chemical agent`)

### Responsible Partner Company

All DML entries are associated with the same responsible partner company:

* **Enterprise Code**: `B6865`
* **Enterprise Name**: `AEROSPACE, SECURITY AND DEFENCE INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF EUROPE`

### Example Entries

Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many more DML entries in the dataset. 

If you need to parse or process the XML data programmatically, I can provide guidance on how to do so using various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java).
