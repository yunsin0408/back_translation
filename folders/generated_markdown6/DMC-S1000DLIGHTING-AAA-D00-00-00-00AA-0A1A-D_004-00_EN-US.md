Functional Physical Area Repository
=====================================

The following is a list of functional physical areas in a bicycle:

### Steering and Suspension

* **Steering**: system that connects the handlebars to the front wheel
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Handlebars
		- Stem
		- Fork
* **Suspension**: system that absorbs shock and vibrations from the road
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Front fork
		- Rear shock

### Drivetrain

* **Drivetrain**: system that transmits power from the pedals to the wheels
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Chainrings
		- Chain
		- Cassette
		- Derailleurs
* **Gears**: system that allows the rider to adjust the difficulty of pedaling
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Front derailleur
		- Rear derailleur
		- Shifters

### Braking System

* **Braking System**: system that slows or stops the bicycle
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Brake calipers
		- Brake levers
		- Brake pads

### Wheels and Tires

* **Wheels**: round, rotating components that support the bicycle's weight
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Rims
		- Hubs
		- Spokes
* **Tires**: rubber components that provide traction and cushioning
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Tire tread
		- Tire sidewall

### Frames and Forks

* **Frames**: main structural component of the bicycle
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Frame tubes
		- Seatpost
		- Headset
* **Forks**: components that connect the front wheel to the frame
	+ Sub-systems:
		- Fork blades
		- Crown

Repository Structure
---------------------

The functional physical area repository is organized into the following categories:

1. Steering and Suspension
2. Drivetrain
3. Braking System
4. Wheels and Tires
5. Frames and Forks

Each category contains sub-systems that are further divided into components.

Example Use Cases
-----------------

* A bicycle manufacturer wants to create a new model with improved steering and suspension. They can use the repository to identify the relevant components and sub-systems.
* A mechanic wants to repair a broken drivetrain component. They can use the repository to locate the specific part and understand its relationship to other components.

XML Representation
------------------

The functional physical area repository can be represented in XML format as follows:
```xml
<functionalPhysicalAreaRepository>
  <steeringAndSuspension>
    <handlebars />
    <stem />
    <fork />
  </steeringAndSuspension>
  <drivetrain>
    <chainrings />
    <chain />
    <cassette />
    <derailleurs />
  </drivetrain>
  <!-- ... -->
</functionalPhysicalAreaRepository>
```
Note: This is a simplified example and the actual XML representation may vary depending on the specific requirements.
