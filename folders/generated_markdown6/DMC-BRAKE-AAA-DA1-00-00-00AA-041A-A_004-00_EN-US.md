### Description
The brake system on a bicycle is an essential component that ensures safe and effective riding. There are nine different types of brake systems, with the cantilever brake being the most common.

#### Brake System Components
The primary components of a cantilever brake system include:
1. **Brake Lever:** The lever is installed in the mount and turns on a lever pivot bolt.
2. **Brake Cable:** A cable that goes from the brake levers on the handlebars pulls the two levers on the brakes together.
3. **Brake Arm:** 
4. **Brake Clamp (Callipers):** 
5. **Brake Pads:** Made out of hard-wearing rubber, the pads press against the rim of the wheel to cause friction when the brake levers are operated.

##### Cantilever Brake
The cantilever brake system has a straddle cable that connects the two brake levers. When the brake levers are pressed, the straddle cable pulls the two levers on the brakes together, which presses the brake pads against the outer rim of the wheel and decreases the speed of the bicycle.

##### Brake Pads
There are four brake pads on a bicycle, two on the front wheel and two on the rear wheel. The brake pads are made out of hard-wearing rubber and press against the rim of the wheel to cause friction when the brake levers are operated.

##### Brake Lever
The brake levers are easily damaged and should be handled with care. The lever is installed in the mount, which is held by a clamp bolt. The adjuster lock nut holds the brake cable and adjusts its tension.
