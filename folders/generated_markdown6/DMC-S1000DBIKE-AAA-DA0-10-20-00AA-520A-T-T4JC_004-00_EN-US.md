Front Wheel Removal

##### Description
The content of this data model describes the steps for removing the bicycle front wheel.

##### Lc Instruction
To remove your bike's front wheel, follow these steps:

1. **Step 1**: Place the bike on a stand. If you do not have a stand, you can still remove the tire. It will just take a little coordination on your part.
	* Begin by either deflating the front tire slightly or disconnecting the front brakes. This is done so the wheel can come out easily and not get stuck at the brake pads.

2. **Step 2**: If your bike has a quick-release lever, push the lever outward and turn it in a counterclockwise motion for several revolutions.

3. **Step 3**: If your bike does not have a quick-release lever, you will need a wrench to loosen the nuts on either side of the hub.
