Code Snippets
-------------

Here are a few code snippets that demonstrate some of the key elements in the S1000D XML file:

### Procedural Step

```xml
<proceduralStep>
  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>Dear <variableRef variableName="name"/>, because you are an unexperienced user, you will be presented a brief introduction on how to operate a bicycle.</para>
</proceduralStep>
```

### Dialog

```xml
<dialog>
  <menu choiceSelection="single" choiceType="select">
    <prompt>
      <paraBasic>The rear brake is operated by</paraBasic>
    </prompt>
    <menuChoice>
      <prompt>
        <paraBasic>Left brake lever</paraBasic>
      </prompt>
      <assertion>
        <variableRef variableName="tourCorrectAnswer"/>
        <expression>
          <booleanValue>
            <falseValue/>
          </booleanValue>
        </expression>
      </assertion>
    </menuChoice>
  </menu>
</dialog>
```

### Variable Post Set

```xml
<variablePostSet>
  <assertion>
    <variableRef variableName="approved Bikers"/>
