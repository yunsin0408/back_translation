## Key Considerations

Tasks require varying levels of skill, from basic operator tasks to those requiring a qualified supervisor/mechanic.

Some tasks reference external documents or DM codes for more detailed information.

Each task has a defined trigger for when it should be performed.

The `applicabilityReference` (app-MK1-9) likely refers to a higher-level document defining the scope and context of this maintenance plan.

Tasks like Hub Bearing Cleaning have defined thresholds (e.g., 6 months) and limits for inspection.
