# S1000D Illustrated Parts Catalog
The following is a breakdown of the provided XML data for an S1000D illustrated parts catalog.

## Introduction
S1000D is an international specification for the production of technical publications. It provides a common standard for creating and managing technical documentation, including illustrated parts catalogs.

## Catalog Structure
The catalog consists of multiple `catalogSeqNumber` elements, each representing a different level of indenture in the parts breakdown.

### Level 1: Bicycle
* Part Number: BICYCLE-001
* Description: Bicycle

### Level 2: Sub-assemblies
#### Frame and Fork
* Part Number: BICYCLE-001/1
* Description: Frame and fork assembly

#### Seat and Handlebars
* Part Number: BICYCLE-001/2
* Description: Seat and handlebar assembly

### Level 3: Component Parts
#### Wheels
* Part Number: WH-001 (Rear)
* Part Number: WH-002 (Front)
* Description: Wheel, assembly rear/front

#### Brakes
* Part Number: LRU1001
* Description: Brake system

#### Computer and Accessories
* Part Number: CP-001
* Description: Computer

## Data Model
The following is a simplified data model representing the structure of the catalog:

* **Catalog**
	+ `catalogSeqNumber` (unique identifier)
	+ `partRef` (part number and manufacturer code)
	+ `itemSeqNumber` (sequence number for each part)
	+ `descrForPart` (description of the part)
	+ `techData` (technical data, including unit of issue and special storage requirements)

## Technical Data
The technical data section includes information such as:

* **Unit of Issue**: The unit in which the part is issued (e.g., each, pair, set).
* **Special Storage Requirements**: Any special handling or storage instructions for the part.

## Example Use Case
To create an illustrated parts catalog using this data model, you would first identify the top-level assembly (in this case, the bicycle). You would then break down the assembly into its sub-assemblies and component parts, assigning a unique `catalogSeqNumber` to each level of indenture. Finally, you would include technical data for each part, such as unit of issue and special storage requirements.

## Code Example
The following is an example of how this data might be represented in XML:
```xml
<dmodule>
  <content>
    <illustratedPartsCatalog>
      <catalogSeqNumber indenture="1" systemCode="D00" subSystemCode="0" assyCode="00" figureNumber="01" figureNumberVariant="A" item="000">
        <itemSeqNumber>00A</itemSeqNumber>
        <partRef manufacturerCode="KZ999" partNumber="BICYCLE-001"/>
        <descrForPart>Bicycle</descrForPart>
      </catalogSeqNumber>
      <!-- Sub-assemblies and component parts -->
    </illustratedPartsCatalog>
  </content>
</dmodule>
```
