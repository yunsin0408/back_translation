S1000D Maintenance Procedure
==========================

### Introduction

This maintenance procedure outlines the steps required to lubricate a bicycle chain.

### Preliminary Requirements
#### Personnel

* One person is required to perform this task.
* The person should have basic mechanical skills and knowledge of bicycle maintenance.

#### Support Equipment

* Clean dry cloth (KZ666, BSK-TLST-001-12)
* Floor covering (KK999, PPP-001)

#### Supplies

* ACME sticky lube 52B (Wet lube) (KZ222, LL-007)
* AECMA Heavy duty Oil 1988 (Dry lube) (B6865, HD1988)

#### Safety Requirements

* **Warning:** ACME sticky lube 52B and AECMA Heavy duty Oil 1988 are very dangerous substances. Do not get them onto your skin. Use them in a well-ventilated area. If you swallow them, seek immediate medical advice. If they get into your eyes, wash your eyes with clean water and seek medical advice.

### Main Procedure
#### Step 1: Apply Penetrating Lubricant

* Apply penetrating lubricant to:
	+ Derailleur pivots (refer to [Figure 1](#figure-1))
	+ Derailleur tension (refer to [Figure 2](#figure-2))
	+ Brake lever pivots (refer to [Figure 3](#figure-3))
* Apply penetrating lubricant to:
	+ Guide wheels
	+ Control cables and where they go into their casings

#### Step 2: Lubricate the Chain

* Make sure the chain is clean and dry.
* Put a floor covering on the floor below the chain.
* **For Dry Conditions:** Apply AECMA Heavy duty Oil 1988 to each roller of the chain (refer to [Figure 4](#figure-4)) but only apply a small quantity.
* **For Wet Conditions:** Apply ACME sticky lube 52B to each roller of the chain (refer to [Figure 4](#figure-4)) but only apply a small quantity.
* Hold the nozzle of the container above the front of the chain ring and slowly turn the cranks rearwards.

### Closing Requirements

* Check the rear wheel rim and clean any unwanted lubricant.
* Check the chain to make sure that each link is lubricated. If there are links that do not move easily or have become frozen, lubricate the chain again (refer to [Step 2](#step-2-lubricate-the-chain)).
* Clean any remaining lubricated parts with a clean dry cloth.
