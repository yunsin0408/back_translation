## Check List
### Check List Procedure
The following steps must be performed to complete the operation test:
1. **Check Condition of Bike**
	* Before every ride, check the condition of the bike.
2. **Check Fasteners**
	* Check all fasteners on the bike.
	+ If no fasteners are loose, proceed to the next step.
	+ If any fasteners are loose, tighten them according to the specific maintenance instruction for the related component.
3. **Lift Front Wheel and Spin**
	* Lift the front wheel off the ground 2-3 inches and let it bounce on the ground.
	+ If nothing rattles or appears to be loose, proceed to the next step.
	+ If the bike rattles or parts appear to be loose, secure the loose part according to the specific maintenance instruction for the related part.
4. **Check Tire Pressure**
	* Check the tire pressure against the specification printed on the side of the tire.
	+ If the tire pressure is correct, proceed to the next step.
	+ If the tire pressure is not within the specification:
		- If the pressure is high, bleed air from the tire until it reaches the maximum pressure printed on the side of the tire.
		- If the pressure is low, add air to the tire not to exceed the maximum pressure printed on the side of the tire.
5. **Inspect Tire for Cuts or Cracks**
	* Inspect the tire for cuts or cracks.
	+ If no damage is found, proceed to the next step.
	+ If visible damage is found:
		- Replace the tire before riding.
6. **Check Wheels for Trueness**
	* Ensure wheels are true spinning, without wobble.
	+ If wheels do not wobble when spinning, proceed to the next step.
	+ If wheels wobble when spinning:
		- Have the bike serviced and have the wheels made true.
7. **Inspect Tire Rims for Wear**
	* Inspect tire rims for wear indicator marks.
	+ If no wear indicator marks are visible, proceed to the next step.
	+ If wear indicator marks are visible:
		- Replace the wheel.
8. **Check Brakes**
	* Squeeze the brake levers and check that front and back brakes securely grip the wheel rim.
	+ If brakes engage within 1 inch of brake lever movement, proceed to the next step.
	+ If brakes do not engage within 1 inch of brake lever movement:
		- Tighten brakes according to maintenance procedure.

## Conclusion
The operation test is complete when all steps have been performed and any necessary repairs or adjustments have been made.
