# DModule Content
The following is a breakdown of the provided XML content.

## Wiring Data
The wiring data contains information about a group of wires. The main components are:

* **Wire Group**: A collection of wires with their respective connections and properties.
* **Wires**: Individual wires with their own unique identifiers, connections, and characteristics.

### Wire Properties

Some common properties found in the wires include:
* **Wire Number**: A unique identifier for each wire (e.g., LL1, ND2).
* **Circuit Identifier**: An identifier for a specific circuit (e.g., YD).
* **Section Identifier**: An identifier for a particular section of the wiring diagram (e.g., AA).
* **From/To Equipment**: The starting and ending points of each wire connection.
* **Wire Code**: A code representing the type and gauge of the wire (e.g., QC, 006 AWG).
* **Harness Identifier**: An identifier for the harness or bundle that the wire belongs to (e.g., 1109VB).
* **Length**: The estimated length of the wire in millimeters.
* **Color**: The color of the wire (e.g., Red, Yellow).
* **Signal Information**: Details about the signal transmitted through the wire (e.g., 115V AC, 400Hz).

### Wire Connections
Each wire has a specific connection defined by:
* **From Equipment**: The starting point of the wire.
* **To Equipment**: The ending point of the wire.
* **Contact Information**: Additional details about the connection, such as screen orders and special connections.

## Wire Alternatives (WireAlts)
The provided XML also includes a section for wire alternatives. This section contains:
* **Alternative Wires**: A collection of wires with their respective properties and connections.
* **Change Authority Data Group**: Information regarding changes made to the wiring diagram, including change authority data and condition numbers.

### Example Wire Alternative
One example of an alternative wire is:
* **Circuit Identifier**: YD
* **Wire Number**: 0486
* **Section Identifier**: AA
* **From Equipment**: 6QXA
* **To Equipment**: 6712VR

This alternative wire has its own unique properties and connections, including a wire code (QC), harness identifier (1109VB), and length (2150 mm).

## Conclusion
The provided XML content contains detailed information about a group of wires, their connections, and properties. The data is structured into categories such as wire groups, individual wires, and alternative wires. Understanding this structure can help in effectively parsing and utilizing the wiring data for various applications.
