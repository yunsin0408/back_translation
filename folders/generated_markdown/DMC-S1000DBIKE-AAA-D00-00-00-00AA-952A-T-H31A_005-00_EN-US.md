### Introduction

This learning plan outlines the strategy for improving the performance of bike couriers at Speedy Courier. The plan focuses on creating a computer-based training program that works in conjunction with hands-on practical exercises.

### Performance Analysis
#### Current Status

The current status of bike couriers is that they lack the necessary skills to perform routine maintenance and repairs on their bikes, leading to decreased productivity and increased downtime.

#### Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of this problem is a lack of training and resources for bike couriers. Currently, there is no structured training program in place to teach bike couriers how to perform routine maintenance and repairs.

### Intervention Definition
#### Computer-Based Training Program

The computer-based training program will cover the following topics:

* Steering system maintenance and repair
* Brake system maintenance and repair
* Gear system maintenance and repair
* Tire maintenance and repair

The program will include interactive modules, videos, and quizzes to engage learners and assess their knowledge.

#### Hands-on Practical Exercises

Hands-on practical exercises will be conducted in a controlled environment, where bike couriers can practice the skills they learned in the computer-based training program. The exercises will cover the following topics:

* Removing and installing steering system parts
* Adjusting brake systems
* Repairing gear systems
* Changing tires

### Intervention Implementation
#### Creation of Training Program

The creation of the training program will involve the development of interactive modules, videos, and quizzes. The program will be designed to be engaging and easy to use.

#### Institution of Training Program

The institution of the training program will involve the rollout of the program to all bike couriers at Speedy Courier. The program will be mandatory for all new hires, and existing employees will be required to complete the program within a specified timeframe.

### Performance Evaluation
#### Formative Evaluation

The formative evaluation will be conducted using surveys to assess the effectiveness of the training program. The surveys will be administered at regular intervals to gather feedback from learners and identify areas for improvement.

#### Summative Evaluation

The summative evaluation will be conducted using surveys as well as the analysis of assessment results. The evaluation will assess the impact of the training program on learner performance and organizational outcomes.

### Technical Requirements
#### Hardware and Software

The following hardware and software are required to run the training program:

* Computer with internet connection
* Adobe Flash Player
* Acrobat Acrobat Reader
* 1024x768 resolution

#### Accessibility

The training program is designed to be accessible to all learners, including those with disabilities. The program meets W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Guidelines Priority 1 checkpoints.

### Conclusion
The learning plan outlined in this document aims to improve the performance of bike couriers at Speedy Courier by providing them with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform routine maintenance and repairs on their bikes. The plan includes a computer-based training program, hands-on practical exercises, and a comprehensive evaluation strategy to ensure the effectiveness of the intervention.
