DMOD Document
================
### Introduction

The DMOD (Digital Maintenance and Operations Data) document is a digital representation of maintenance and operations data for a specific system or equipment. The purpose of this document is to provide a clear and concise guide for the assembly, installation, and maintenance of the lighting system on a mountain bike.

### System Description

The lighting system consists of two main components:

* Front light
* Rear light

Both lights are connected to a circuit breaker, which is installed on the handlebar.

### Preliminary Requirements

Before starting the installation process, ensure that the following requirements are met:

* The bike is stationary
* The work area is clear and well-lit
* All necessary tools and equipment are available

#### Required Tools and Equipment

The following tools and equipment are required for the installation process:

* Specialist toolset (BSK-TLST-001)
* Screwdriver
* Protective strip
* Clamp
* Washer
* Screw

### Installation Procedure

The installation procedure consists of several steps, which must be followed in sequence.

#### Step 1: Remove Packaging

Remove the lighting system from its packaging and ensure that all components are included.

#### Step 2: Install Front Light Fitting

Install the front light fitting on the top of the handlebar.

* Apply protective strip around the handlebar
* Pull the clamp open and put it around the protective strip with the light connector at the top
* Install the washer on the screw
* Use the correct screwdriver from the specialist toolset and tighten the screw into the hole at the bottom of the clamp

#### Step 3: Install Rear Light Fitting

Install the rear light fitting to the rear triangle of the bike frame.

* Apply protective strip around one of the two rear triangle up-tubes
* Pull the clamp open and put it around the protective strip, making sure the light connector points rearwards
* Install the washer on the screw
* Use the correct screwdriver from the specialist toolset and tighten the screw into the hole at the bottom of the clamp

#### Step 4: Connect Lights to Circuit Breaker

Connect the lights to the circuit breaker.

* For Mountain bike Storm type:
	+ Install the circuit breaker (CBLGT-1001-R) on the right-hand bike handlebar using the clamping ring
	+ Connect the circuit breaker electrical wire to the rear connector of the front light
	+ Attach the wire to the frame with protective strip
* For Mountain bike Trekker type:
	+ Install the circuit breaker (CBLGT-1001-L) on the left-hand bike handlebar using the clamping ring
	+ Connect the circuit breaker electrical wire to the rear connector of the front light
	+ Attach the wire to the frame with protective strip

#### Figures and Illustrations

The following figures illustrate the installation process:

* [Figure 1: Circuit Breaker (for right side)](ICN-FAPE3-S1000D0101-001-01)
* [Figure 2: Circuit Breaker (for left side)](ICN-FAPE3-S1000D0102-001-01)

### Closing Requirements

After completing the installation process, ensure that the following requirements are met:

* All tools and equipment are stored properly
* The work area is clean and clear of debris

By following this guide, you should be able to successfully install the lighting system on your mountain bike.
