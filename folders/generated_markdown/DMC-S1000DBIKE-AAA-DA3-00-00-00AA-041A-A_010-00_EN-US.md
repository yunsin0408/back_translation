### Description
The bicycle frame is the main structure of the bike, and it's designed to withstand various forces. The initial frames were made from aluminum or steel tubes welded together.

```
Later frames can be made from a wide range of materials, including aluminum, titanium, or chrome moly.

```
Other frames are different and can also be made from various materials, such as titanium or chrome moly. Some bicycle frames are made of carbon fiber, which is created by layering carbon fiber cloth on foam forms and epoxying them in place.

The frame consists of several parts:
1. **Top Tube:** The higher bar of the bicycle frame.
2. **Down Tube:** The section of the frame that extends from the stem to the bottom bracket.
3. **Head Tube:** The part of the frame where the fork steerer tube is inserted.
4. **Seat Tube:** The vertical part of the frame between the bottom bracket and the top tube.
5. **Seat Stay:** The tube that connects the seat tube and the rear dropouts.
6. **Chain Stay:** The tube that forms the bottom part of the rear triangle.
