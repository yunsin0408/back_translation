Functional Physical Area Repository
=====================================

The functional physical area repository contains a collection of functional physical areas used to describe the components and systems of a bicycle. The repository is organized into a hierarchical structure, with each level representing a more specific or detailed description of the component or system.

### Top-Level Categories

The top-level categories in the repository are:

1. **Steering**: Components related to steering the bicycle.
2. **Drivetrain**: Components related to transmitting power from the pedals to the wheels.
3. **Gears**: Components related to changing the gear ratio of the drivetrain.
4. **Brakes**: Components related to slowing or stopping the bicycle.

### Steering Sub-Categories

The steering category has the following sub-categories:

1. **Handlebars**: The component that connects the rider's hands to the front wheel.
2. **Stem**: The component that connects the handlebars to the frame.
3. **Fork**: The component that connects the front wheel to the frame.

### Drivetrain Sub-Categories

The drivetrain category has the following sub-categories:

1. **Chainrings**: The components that transmit power from the pedals to the chain.
2. **Chain**: The component that transmits power from the chainrings to the cassette.
3. **Cassette**: The component that contains the gears that the chain engages with.

### Gears Sub-Categories

The gears category has the following sub-categories:

1. **Derailleurs**: The components that move the chain between different gears on the cassette.
2. **Shifters**: The components that control the derailleurs to change the gear ratio.
3. **Cassette**: The component that contains the gears that the chain engages with.

### Brakes Sub-Categories

The brakes category has the following sub-categories:

1. **Brake Calipers**: The components that apply pressure to the brake pads to slow or stop the wheel.
2. **Brake Pads**: The components that contact the rim or rotor to slow or stop the wheel.
3. **Levers**: The components that control the brake calipers to apply pressure to the brake pads.

Example Use Cases
-----------------

* A bicycle manufacturer uses the functional physical area repository to describe the components and systems of their latest model.
* A cyclist uses the repository to identify the specific component that needs to be replaced or upgraded on their bike.
* A mechanic uses the repository to understand the relationships between different components and systems when performing repairs or maintenance.

Code Snippets
-------------

The following code snippets demonstrate how to access and manipulate the functional physical area repository:

```xml
<functionalPhysicalAreaRepository>
  <commonRepository>
    <content>
      <!-- Top-level categories -->
      <functionalPhysicalAreaSpec id="sns-001">
        <functionalPhysicalAreaIdent systemCode="DA1" subSystemCode="0"/>
        <shortName>Steering</shortName>
      </functionalPhysicalAreaSpec>
      <functionalPhysicalAreaSpec id="sns-002">
        <functionalPhysicalAreaIdent systemCode="DA2" subSystemCode="0"/>
        <shortName>Drivetrain</shortName>
      </functionalPhysicalAreaSpec>
      <!-- Sub-categories -->
      <functionalPhysicalAreaSpec id="sns-003">
        <functionalPhysicalAreaIdent systemCode="DA1" subSystemCode="1"/>
        <shortName>Handlebars</shortName>
      </functionalPhysicalAreaSpec>
      <functionalPhysicalAreaSpec id="sns-004">
        <functionalPhysicalAreaIdent systemCode="DA2" subSystemCode="1"/>
        <shortName>Chainrings</shortName>
      </functionalPhysicalAreaSpec>
    </content>
  </commonRepository>
</functionalPhysicalAreaRepository>
```

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# Load the functional physical area repository from XML file
tree = ET.parse('functional_physical_area_repository.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

# Access a specific top-level category
steering_category = root.find('.//functionalPhysicalAreaSpec[@id="sns-001"]')

# Print the short name of the steering category
print(steering_category.find('shortName').text)
```
