# Introduction to Bicycle Components
=====================================

## Overview of Bicycle History
-----------------------------

The first bicycle was invented in 1817 by German Baron Karl von Drais. Over the years, the design has evolved to include various components that enhance its functionality and performance.

### Key Milestones in Bicycle Development

* 1817: Invention of the first bicycle by Karl von Drais
* Late 1800s: Introduction of the chain-driven mechanism
* Early 1900s: Development of derailleur systems for gear shifting

## Components of a Bicycle
---------------------------

A typical bicycle consists of several key components that work together to provide a safe and efficient ride. These include:

### Frame and Fork

* The frame is the main structure of the bicycle, providing support for the other components.
* The fork is attached to the frame and holds the front wheel in place.

### Wheels and Tires

* The wheels are responsible for rotating and providing traction on the road or trail.
* The tires provide cushioning and grip, with different types suitable for various terrain and conditions.

### Drivetrain

* The drivetrain includes the pedals, cranks, chainrings, chain, and gears.
* The pedals convert the rider's leg motion into rotational energy.
* The cranks transfer this energy to the chainrings, which engage the chain and propel the bicycle forward.
* The gears provide different ratios for efficient pedaling in various conditions.

### Braking System

* The braking system includes the brake levers, calipers, and pads.
* When the rider operates the brake levers, the calipers squeeze the pads against the wheel rims or rotors, slowing or stopping the bicycle.

### Handlebars and Stem

* The handlebars provide a comfortable grip for the rider and attach to the stem.
* The stem connects the handlebars to the frame, allowing for adjustments in height and position.

## Detailed Component Descriptions
-----------------------------------

The following sections provide more detailed information on each component:

### 1. Shifters

* **Function:** Change gears by pulling or loosening the control cable.
* **Types:** 7 different types of shifters have been developed over the years, with varying functionality and design.

### 2. Crank

* **Function:** Convert pedal motion into rotational energy.
* **Description:** The crank moves the power to the chainrings when the pedals operate.

### 3. Pedals

* **Function:** Transfer force from the rider's feet to the cranks.
* **Description:** The pedals move the force of movement from the feet to the cranks, propelling the bicycle forward.

### 4. Chain

* **Function:** Transfer power from the chainrings to the cogs on the freewheel.
* **Maintenance:** Regular cleaning and lubrication are essential for optimal performance.

### 5. Gears

* **Function:** Provide different mechanisms for changing the speed of the bicycle.
* **Components:** Include sprockets, chain, and derailleur.

### 6. Chain Rings

* **Function:** Pull on the chain when the cranks turn.
* **Description:** Also known as the "chain wheel."

### 7. Derailleur

* **Function:** Move the chain from one sprocket to another to change gears.
* **Types:** Front and rear derailleurs, with different designs and functionality.
