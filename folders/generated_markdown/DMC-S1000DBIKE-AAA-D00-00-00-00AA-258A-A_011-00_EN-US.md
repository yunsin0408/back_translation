S1000D Bike Maintenance Procedure
=====================================

### Introduction

This procedure outlines the steps required to maintain a bike, including cleaning, lubricating, and safety precautions.

### Required Materials

* Water hose (low pressure)
* Degreasing agent (ACME super 45 Agent)

### Safety Precautions

* **Warning:** Do not get degreasing agent or detergent into your eyes. If it gets into your eyes, wash them immediately in clean warm water (H2O).
