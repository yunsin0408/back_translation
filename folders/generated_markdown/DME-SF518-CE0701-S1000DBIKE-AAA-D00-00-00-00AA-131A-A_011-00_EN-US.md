### Introduction

This document outlines a pre-ride inspection checklist for a bicycle. The checklist covers various components, including brakes, tires, wheels, headset, chain, handlebar, and computer.

### Pre-Ride Inspection Checklist

#### Brakes

1. **Pads**:
	* Check pad width
	* Check pad clearance
2. **Callipers**:
	* Ensure link wire is firmly attached
3. **Levers**:
	* Check for approximately 1 inch of travel before engagement
	* Check for space between lever and handlebar when fully pulled
4. **Cables**:
	* Inspect for cuts or fraying

#### Tires

1. **Pressure**:
	* Refer to the table below for recommended pressures
	| Terrain | Min Pressure | Max Pressure |
	| --- | --- | --- |
	| Off Road | 35 lbs | 40 lbs |
	| On Road | 55 lbs | 60 lbs |
2. **Condition**:
	* Check for cracks or splits

#### Wheels

1. **Bearings**:
	* Ensure bearings are not loose
2. **Trueness**:
	* Check if the wheel is true
3. **Spokes**:
	* Check for broken spokes
	* If spokes are not broken, ensure they are tight
4. **Axel Nuts**:
	* Ensure axel nuts are tight

#### Headset

1. **Bearing Tightness**:
	* Ensure headset bearings are tight

#### Chain

1. **Link Movement**:
	* Check for easy movement of links

#### Handlebar

1. **Stem Condition**:
	* Do not ride with a cracked stem
	* If the stem is loose, tighten it
2. **Handlebar Twist**:
	* If handlebars twist in stem, tighten clamp bolt

#### Computer

1. **Display**:
	* Check computer display for speed and distance readings

Example Use Case
---------------

To perform a pre-ride inspection, follow these steps:

1. Start with the brakes: check pads, callipers, levers, and cables.
2. Move on to tires: check pressure and condition.
3. Inspect wheels: bearings, trueness, spokes, and axel nuts.
4. Check headset bearing tightness.
5. Verify chain link movement.
6. Examine handlebar stem condition and tighten if necessary.
7. Finally, check computer display for speed and distance readings.

By following this checklist, you can ensure your bicycle is in good working condition before heading out on a ride.
