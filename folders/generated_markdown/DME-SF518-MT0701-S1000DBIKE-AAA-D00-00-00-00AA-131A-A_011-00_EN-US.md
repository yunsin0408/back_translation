### Introduction

This document contains pre-ride checks for a bicycle.

### Pre-Ride Checks

1. **Brakes**
   - Check the pads: 
     * Are they worn out?
     * Is there sufficient clearance between the rim and brake pad?
   - Inspect the levers:
     * Do they have about 1 inch of travel before engagement?
     * Is there space between the lever and handlebar when fully pulled?
   - Check cables for cuts or fraying.
2. **Tires**
   - Pressure: 
     | Terrain      | Min Pressure | Max Pressure |
     |--------------|--------------|--------------|
     | Off Road     | 35lbs        | 40lbs        |
     | On Road      | 55lbs        | 60lbs        |
   - Check for cracks or splits.
3. **Wheels**
   - Ensure there are no loose bearings.
   - Verify the wheels are true and round.
   - Inspect spokes:
     * Are they broken?
     * Are they tight (if not broken)?
4. **Headset**
   - Make sure the headset bearings are tightened properly.
5. **Chain**
   - Check for easy movement of links.
6. **Handlebar**
   - Warning: Do not ride with a cracked stem.
   - If the stem is:
     * Cracked, replace it.
     * Loose, tighten it.
   - If handlebars twist in the stem, tighten the clamp bolt.

### Computer Display

- **Altitude**: 0 miles
