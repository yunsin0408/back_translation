# Introduction
The provided XML document contains rules for creating bike data modules. These rules are divided into two categories: context rules and non-context rules.

## Context Rules
Context rules define the structure and content of bike data modules. They include:

### Structure Object Rule Group
This group contains 24 structure object rules that specify the allowed values for various elements in the data module. Some examples include:
* Maintenance level (e.g., maintenance, repair)
* Originator code (e.g., EPWG)
* Limit type (e.g., time between overhaul, hard time)
* Unit of measurement for threshold intervals (e.g., months, weeks)

### Notation Rule List
This list contains one notation rule that specifies the allowed notation for encoding 3D models. In this case, Flash animation is not allowed in the project.

## Non-Context Rules
Non-context rules are general guidelines that apply to all bike data modules. There are two non-context rules:
1. **Review and Approval**: Bike data modules must be reviewed and approved by EPWG before publishing.
2. **Examples of Concept Sophistication**: The bike data set must contain examples of how to apply constructs and principles representing various levels of concept sophistication.

## Example Use Cases
These rules can be applied in the following scenarios:
* Creating a new bike data module: The structure object rule group provides guidance on the allowed values for various elements, ensuring consistency across all modules.
* Reviewing an existing bike data module: The non-context rules provide a checklist to ensure that the module meets the required standards.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the provided XML document contains essential rules for creating and reviewing bike data modules. By following these context and non-context rules, creators can ensure that their modules are consistent, accurate, and meet the required standards.
