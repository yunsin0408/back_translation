# PM Data Extract

This document provides a structured overview of the data extracted from the provided PM (Product Management?) XML snippet.  The data represents entries related to a product (likely a vehicle or complex machine given the system/subsystem coding) and associated issues/information.

## Data Structure

The data is organized within a `<pmEntry>` tag. Each `<dmRef>` tag within represents a single entry.  Key attributes within each entry include:

*   **`applicRefId`**:  An identifier for the application or specific context of the entry.
*   **`modelIdentCode`**: The model identifier (always "S1000DBIKE" in this dataset).
*   **`systemCode`**:  Identifies the system or subsystem. (e.g., "DA4", "DA5").
*   **`subSystemCode`**:  Further identifies a component within the system (e.g., "1", "2", "0").
*   **`infoCode`**:  A code representing a specific piece of information or issue.
*   **`infoCodeVariant`**:  A variant of the `infoCode`, potentially indicating a revision or specific type of issue.
*   **`itemLocationCode`**:  Indicates the location of the item or issue.
*   **`issueNumber`**:  A numeric identifier for the issue.
*   **`inWork`**:  A flag indicating whether the issue is currently being worked on (always "00" in this data, meaning likely not).

## Data Summary

The following table summarizes the data extracted from the XML.  This table is organized by `systemCode` for easier analysis.  Due to the length of the data, only key attributes are included.

| System Code | Sub System Code | Info Code | Info Code Variant | Issue Number | Item Location Code | Applic Ref Id |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DA3 | 0 | 041 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA3 | 1 | 411 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA3 | 1 | 921 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA4 | 0 | 041 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA4 | 1 | 241 | A | 011 | A | app-006 |
| DA4 | 1 | 251 | B | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA4 | 1 | 414 | A | 008 | A | app-001 |
| DA5 | 0 | 041 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA5 | 1 | 041 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA5 | 2 | 251 | C | 011 | A | app-001 |
| DA5 | 3 | 041 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA4 | 1 | 251 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA3 | 0 | 041 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA5 | 0 | 041 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |
| DA4 | 0 | 041 | A | 010 | A | app-001 |

## Observations & Potential Analysis

*   **System Coverage:** The data covers systems DA3, DA4, and DA5.
*   **Issue Status:** All issues in this dataset have `inWork` set to "00," suggesting they are either resolved or not currently being actively addressed.
*   **Info Code Variants:**  The use of `infoCodeVariant` (A, B, C) indicates that the `infoCode` represents a general category, and the variant provides more specific details.
*   **Applic Ref Id diversity:** Different `applicRefId` values suggest multiple applications or data sources contributing to this dataset.
*   **Potential use cases:** This data could be used for:
    *   Tracking issues and resolutions.
    *   Analyzing system reliability.
    *   Identifying areas for improvement.
    *   Generating reports on system performance.

## Conclusion

This document provides a summarized view of the extracted PM data.  Further analysis could reveal more detailed insights into the product's performance and areas for improvement.
