# Bicycle Pre-Ride Check Procedure

This document outlines the pre-ride check procedure for bicycles, covering key areas to ensure safety and optimal performance.

## 1. Brakes

*   **Check Pads:** Ensure brake pads have sufficient material.
*   **Lever Action:** Verify smooth and firm lever action.

## 2. Tires

*   **Inflation:** Check tire pressure. Recommended ranges:
    *   **On Road:** 55-60 psi
    *   **Off Road:** 35-40 psi
*   **Condition:** Inspect tires for cracks, splits, or embedded objects.

## 3. Wheels

*   **Bearings:** Check for loose bearings.
*   **Trueness:** Ensure wheels are true (not wobbling).
*   **Spokes:** Verify spokes are not broken and are tight.
*   **Axle Nuts:** Ensure axle nuts are tight.

## 4. Headset

*   **Tightness:** Check for headset bearing tightness.  Ensure smooth steering operation.

## 5. Chain

*   **Movement:** Verify easy movement of chain links.

## 6. Handlebar and Stem

*   **Stem Condition:** *Warning: Do not ride with a cracked stem.*
    *   If stem is cracked: Replace stem.
    *   If stem is loose: Tighten stem.
*   **Clamp Bolt:** If handlebars twist in stem: Tighten clamp bolt.

## 7. Computer (if equipped)

*   **Display Readings:** Verify the computer displays appropriate readings.  Example readings (may vary by model):
    *   **Altitude:** 0 miles
    *   **Speed:** 0 mph
    *   **Distance:** 0 miles
