## Procedure

### 1. Removing the Wheel and Tube

1.  Remove the rear wheel. (Refer to [DM Reference](<dmRef> with `modelIdentCode="S1000DBIKE"`, `systemDiffCode="AAA"`, `systemCode="DA0"`, `subSystemCode="2"`, `subSubSystemCode="0"`, `assyCode="00"`, `disassyCode="00"`, `disassyCodeVariant="AA"`, `infoCode="520"`, `infoCodeVariant="A"`))
2.  Ensure there is no air remaining in the tube.
3.  Loosen the cap on the valve stem.
4.  Push the valve stem core down to bleed all air.
5.  Use a tire lever to move the tire bead out of its seat, lifting it above the rim lip.
6.  Remove the tube.

### 2. Locating and Preparing the Puncture

1.  Inflate the tube slightly with the foot pump.
2.  Examine the tube for leaks.
3.  Identify any leaks with a circle drawn using the marker pen.
4.  Release most of the air from the tube.

### 3. Applying the Patch

1.  Use sandpaper from the tube patch kit to roughen the area around the puncture.
2.  Apply a thin layer of glue from the patch kit over the roughened area, ensuring it's larger than the puncture.
3.  Allow the glue to dry for approximately five minutes, until it becomes tacky and dull.
4.  Remove the protective foil from the patch.
5.  Apply the patch over the glue, centering it on the puncture.
6.  Press firmly from the center of the patch outwards, ensuring good adhesion.
7.  Remove the thin cover from the patch.
8.  Apply a light dusting of talcum powder around the patch.

### 4. Reinstalling the Tube and Wheel

1.  Slightly inflate the repaired tube with the foot pump.
2.  Starting at the valve stem, carefully install the tube between the tire and the rim.
3.  Push the valve stem through the hole in the rim, ensuring it is straight.
4.  Install the remaining portion of the tire onto the rim.
5.  Reinstall the wheel onto the bicycle.
