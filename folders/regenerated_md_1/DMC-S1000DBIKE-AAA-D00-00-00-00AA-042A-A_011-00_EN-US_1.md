# Bicycle Overview

## Description

This document provides an overview of a bicycle, covering its history, components, and functionality.

## History

The bicycle has a rich history, evolving from early "velocipedes" to the modern machines we know today. Key milestones include:

*   **Early 19th Century:** Development of the "draisienne" or "velocipede," a human-powered vehicle without pedals.
*   **1860s:** Introduction of the "boneshaker," featuring pedals attached to the front wheel.
*   **1870s:** The "penny-farthing" emerged, with a large front wheel and a smaller rear wheel.
*   **Late 19th Century:** The "safety bicycle" with equal-sized wheels, a chain drive, and pneumatic tires became the standard.
*   **20th & 21st Centuries:** Continuous advancements in materials, design, and technology, leading to specialized bicycles for various purposes.

## Components & Functionality

### Frame & Basic Structure

The bicycle frame provides the structural foundation. Common frame materials include steel, aluminum, carbon fiber, and titanium. 

### Wheels & Tires

*   **Wheels:** Consist of a hub, spokes, and a rim.
*   **Tires:** Provide cushioning and traction. Types include clincher, tubular, and tubeless.

### Drivetrain

The drivetrain transmits power from the pedals to the wheels. Key components include:

*   **Pedals:** Where the rider applies force.
*   **Crank:** Converts pedal motion into rotational force.
*   **Chainrings:** Gears attached to the crank.
*   **Chain:** Connects the chainrings to the rear cogs.
*   **Cassette/Freewheel:** Gears on the rear wheel.
*   **Derailleurs (Front & Rear):** Shift the chain between different gears.
*   **Shifters:** Control the derailleurs.

### Braking System

*   **Brake Levers:** Activated by the rider.
*   **Brake Calipers/Discs:** Apply friction to slow or stop the wheels.
*   **Brake Pads:** Contact the rim or rotor to create friction.

### Steering & Control

*   **Handlebars:** Used for steering and control.
*   **Stem:** Connects the handlebars to the steering tube.
*   **Headset:** Allows the steering tube to rotate smoothly.

### Other Components

*   **Seat/Saddle:** Provides a comfortable seating surface.
*   **Seatpost:** Connects the seat to the frame.
*   **Fork:** Holds the front wheel and contributes to steering.

| Component        | Function                                                                     |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frame**          | Provides the structural foundation for all other components.                  |
| **Wheels**         | Allow the bicycle to roll and provide stability.                            |
| **Tires**          | Provide cushioning, traction, and grip.                                     |
| **Pedals**         | Where the rider applies force to initiate movement.                          |
| **Crank**          | Converts pedal motion into rotational force.                                |
| **Chainrings**      | Gears attached to the crank that drive the chain.                          |
| **Chain**          | Transmits power from the chainrings to the rear cogs.                         |
| **Cassette/Freewheel** | Gears on the rear wheel that determine the gear ratio.                     |
| **Derailleurs**     | Shift the chain between different gears.                                    |
| **Shifters**        | Control the derailleurs.                                                    |
| **Brake Levers**    | Activate the brakes.                                                        |
| **Brakes**          | Slow or stop the bicycle.                                                   |
| **Handlebars**      | Used for steering and control.                                              |
| **Stem**            | Connects the handlebars to the steering tube.                                |
| **Seat/Saddle**     | Provides a comfortable seating surface.                                     |
| **Seatpost**        | Connects the seat to the frame.                                              |
| **Fork**            | Holds the front wheel and contributes to steering.                            |
