# Bicycle Pre-Flight Check Procedure

## Introduction

This document details the procedure for performing a pre-flight check on a bicycle, ensuring its safe and reliable operation.

## Preliminary Requirements

### Personnel

*   1 Technician

### Equipment

*   **Tire Pressure Gauge:** (KZ666, Part Number: BSK-TLST-001-01) - Quantity: 1
*   **Specialist Toolset:** (KZ666, Part Number: BSK-TLST-001) - Quantity: 1

### Supplies

*   **General Lubricant:** (KZ222, Part Number: LL-001) - As required

## Main Procedure

### Step 1: Brake Inspection

1.  Open the brake quick release.
2.  Examine the condition and thickness of the brake pads.
    *   Ensure sufficient rubber remains.
    *   Verify the pads are not overly hardened.
3.  Clean any unwanted material from the brake surfaces.

### Step 2: Brake Installation Check

1.  Check the hydraulic brake system function (refer to multimedia object: Hydraulic brake function - infoEntityIdent: ICN-C0419-S1000D0384-001-01).
2.  Ensure sufficient clearance exists between the brake pads and the inner diameter of the brake surface.
3.  **Caution:** If the pads are too low on the rim (as shown in Figure 1 - ICN-C0419-S1000D0382-001-01), they may cause spoke separation. Ensure pads are correctly installed in the center.

### Step 3: Tire Pressure Check

1.  Check the tire pressure using the tire pressure gauge.
2.  Compare the reading to the recommended pressure indicated on the tire sidewall.
3.  Add air as needed.

### Step 4: Wheel Inspection

1.  Examine the rims for bulges and dents.
2.  Inspect for splits at the seam of extruded rims.

### Step 5: Headset Bearing Check

1.  Straddle the bicycle.
2.  Apply the front brakes.
3.  Push the handlebars forward.
4.  Verify the headset bearings are tight.

### Step 6: Chain Check

1.  Visually examine the chain condition.
    *   If dirty, clean the chain (refer to document: DA4, 1, 0, 0, 0, B).
2.  Visually inspect for frozen or stiff chain links.
3.  Apply lubricant as needed.
4.  Check chain tension.
    *   Move the chain onto the largest chain ring.
    *   Pull the chain away from the front of the chain ring.
    *   Ensure the play is minimal (less than a full tooth).
    *   Tighten the chain using the specialist toolset.

## Closing Requirements

*   No specific closing requirements.
