# Bike DModule - Context and Non-Context Rules

This document outlines the context and non-context rules defined within the provided DModule, detailing allowed values and project guidelines.

## Context Rules

The DModule defines a comprehensive set of context rules, categorized within `structureObjectRuleGroup` and `notationRuleList`. These rules govern the valid values for specific data elements and notations used within the Bike data set.

### Structure Object Rule Groups

The `structureObjectRuleGroup` defines allowed values for various object types.  Here's a breakdown:

* **`limitType/@limitUnitType`:** Defines the types of limits:
    * Time between overhaul
    * Hard time
    * Since last maintenance
    * Out time limit
    * On condition
    * Check maintenance
    * Functional check

* **`threshold/@thresholdUnitOfMeasure`:** Defines units of measurement for threshold intervals:
    * Months
    * Weeks
    * Years
    * Days
    * Shop visits
    * Auxiliary power unit change
    * Wheel change
    * Kilometer (lexical)

* **`sourceType/@sourceTypeCode`:**  Indicates the type of source:
    * fec
    * sample

* **`sourceType/@sourceCriticality`:** Indicates the impact of non-compliance:
    * Evident, Safety
    * Evident, operational
    * Evident, Economic
    * Hidden, Safety
    * Hidden, Non-Safety

* **`verbatimText/@verbatimStyle`:** Defines styles for verbatim text, including:
    * Generic verbatim
    * Filename
    * XML/SGML markup and related elements (element name, attribute name/value, entity name, processing instruction)
    * Program prompt, user input, output, listing, variable name/value, constant, class name, parameter name.

* **Other Object Rules:** The document details allowed values for the following objects:
    * `limitType/@limitUnitType`
    * `threshold/@thresholdUnitOfMeasure`
    * `sourceType/@sourceTypeCode`
    * `sourceType/@sourceCriticality`
    * `verbatimText/@verbatimStyle`
    * Various other element types (see the original XML for a complete list).

### Notation Rules

* **`-//S1000D//NOTATION X-SHOCKWAVE-FLASH 3D Models Encoding//EN`:**  Flash animation is *not* allowed in this project.



## Non-Context Rules

The DModule also includes non-context rules, which are general guidelines or requirements.

* **`BIKE-BR-00078`:** Bike data modules *must* be reviewed and approved by the EPWG (Engineering Publication Working Group) before publication.
* **`BIKE-BR-00079`:** The Bike data set *must* contain examples demonstrating the application of constructs and principles at various levels of conceptual sophistication.
