## Content

### Description

*   **levelledPara:**
    *   **title:** The bicycle frame
    *   **para:** The frame is the skeleton, the primary part of your bicycle. Its structure makes the bicycle resistant to large forces.
    *   **para:** The initial frames (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0001" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>) were tubes of aluminum or steel welded together.
    *   **figure:**
        *   **id:** fig-0001
        *   **title:** Welded frame joints
        *   **graphic:** infoEntityIdent="ICN-C0419-S1000D0394-001-01"
    *   **para:** Subsequent frames (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0002" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>) can be made out of a wide variety of materials, including aluminium, titanium, or chrome moly.
    *   **figure:**
        *   **id:** fig-0002
        *   **title:** Frame
        *   **graphic:** infoEntityIdent="ICN-C0419-S1000D0393-001-01"
    *   **para:** Other Frames are different and can also be of different materials (for example, titanium or chrome moly). Some bicycle frames are of carbon fiber. To get this material, it is necessary to put sheets of carbon fiber cloth on foam forms and epoxy them in position. This procedure gives a very light, strong structure that can have different shapes.
    *   **para:** The frame includes the parts that follow:
        *   `randomList`:
            *   `listItem`: the top tube (the higher bar of the bicycle frame)
            *   `listItem`: the down tube (the section of the frame that extends from the stem to the bottom bracket)
            *   `listItem`: the head tube (the part of the frame that the fork steerer tube goes through)
            *   `listItem`: the seat tube (the vertical part of the frame that is the rear of the front triangle and that is between the bottom bracket and the top tube)
            *   `listItem`: the seat stay (the tube that includes the distance between the seat tube and the rear dropouts)
            *   `listItem`: the chain stay (the tube that is the bottom part of the rear triangle)
