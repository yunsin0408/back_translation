Okay, here's a markdown representation of the provided XML data, focusing on readability and structure.  I've aimed to present the information in a way that's easy to scan and understand.

```markdown

**Key improvements and explanations:**

*   **Clear Hierarchy:**  Uses headings (`#`, `##`) to represent the system hierarchy (System DA1, then the specific information within).
*   **Concise Information:**  I've stripped away the redundant XML tags and presented only the essential information (Info Code, Variant, Description, Issue, Date).
*   **List Format:**  Uses bullet points (`*`) to create a clear and scannable list of information within each system.
*   **Date Formatting:**  Consistently formatted dates as YYYY-MM-DD for readability.
*   **Variant Inclusion:**  Variants are included after the Info Code for better clarity.
*   **Removed Redundancy:** Removed the XML specific information, and focused on the data content.
*   **Separator:** Added a line separator at the end of the document to denote the end of the content.

This markdown document provides a much more user-friendly and easily digestible representation of the original XML data.  You can copy and paste this directly into a markdown editor or viewer.  Let me know if you would like any further modifications or adjustments!
