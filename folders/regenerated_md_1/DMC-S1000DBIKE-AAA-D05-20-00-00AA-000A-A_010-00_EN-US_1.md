# Bicycle Maintenance Planning Document

This document outlines the maintenance planning for a bicycle, detailing various tasks and their associated requirements.

## Overview

The document defines a series of maintenance tasks, each with specific prerequisites, resource needs, and inspection criteria.  Tasks vary in complexity and required skill level.

## Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Post-Ride Inspection (Task ID: 001)

*   **Worthiness Limit:** Recommended
*   **Applicability Reference:** app-MK1-9
*   **Description:**  A routine inspection performed after each ride to identify immediate issues.
*   **Prerequisites:** None
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Personnel:** 1 Operator (estimated time: 0.1 hours)
    *   **Equipment:** None
*   **Inspection Criteria:** Visual check for damage or wear.
*   **Trigger:** After each ride.

### 2. Tire Pressure Check (Task ID: 002)

*   **Worthiness Limit:** Recommended
*   **Applicability Reference:** app-MK1-9
*   **Description:**  Checking and adjusting tire pressure.
*   **Prerequisites:** None
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Personnel:** 1 Operator (estimated time: 0.1 hours)
    *   **Equipment:** Tire pressure gauge, pump.
*   **Inspection Criteria:** Tire pressure within recommended range.
*   **Trigger:** Weekly or before each longer ride.

### 3. Brake System Check (Task ID: 003)

*   **Worthiness Limit:** Recommended
*   **Applicability Reference:** app-MK1-9
*   **Description:** Inspecting brake pads, cables, and levers for wear or damage.
*   **Prerequisites:** None
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Personnel:** 1 Operator (estimated time: 0.2 hours)
    *   **Equipment:** None
*   **Inspection Criteria:**  Proper brake function and pad thickness.
*   **Trigger:** Weekly or before each ride.

### 4. Chain Lubrication (Task ID: 004)

*   **Worthiness Limit:** Recommended
*   **Applicability Reference:** app-MK1-9
*   **Description:** Applying lubricant to the chain for smooth operation.
*   **Prerequisites:** None
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Personnel:** 1 Operator (estimated time: 0.1 hours)
    *   **Equipment:** Lubricant, rag.
*   **Inspection Criteria:** Chain visibly lubricated.
*   **Trigger:** As needed, based on riding conditions.

### 5. Hub Bearing Cleaning (Task ID: 005)

*   **Worthiness Limit:** Recommended
*   **Applicability Reference:** app-MK1-9
*   **Description:** Cleaning the hub bearings.
*   **Prerequisites:** Rear wheel removed (referenced DM Code: S1000DBIKE, system DA0, sub-system 2)
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Personnel:** 1 Supervisor (skill level sk03, estimated time: 0.8 hours), 1 Operator (estimated time: 0.3 hours)
    *   **Equipment:** Specialist toolset
    *   **Supplies:** Degreasing agent, general grease
*   **Inspection Criteria:** Smooth bearing rotation.
*   **Trigger:** Every 6 months or after excessive exposure to water/dirt.
*   **External Requirement:** Referenced external publication: D6-1234, "My Publication", January 2007, Rev 1.

## Key Considerations

*   **Skill Levels:** Tasks require varying levels of skill, from basic operator tasks to those requiring a qualified supervisor/mechanic.
*   **External References:** Some tasks reference external documents or DM codes for more detailed information.
*   **Inspection Triggers:** Each task has a defined trigger for when it should be performed.
*   **Applicability:** The `applicabilityReference` (app-MK1-9) likely refers to a higher-level document defining the scope and context of this maintenance plan.
* **Thresholds and Limits:** Tasks like Hub Bearing Cleaning have defined thresholds (e.g., 6 months) and limits for inspection.
