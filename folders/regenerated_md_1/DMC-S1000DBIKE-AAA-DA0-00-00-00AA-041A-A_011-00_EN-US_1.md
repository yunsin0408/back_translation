### Description

#### Levelled Para

*   **title:** The bicycle wheel
*   **para:** The wheel (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0001" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>) of a bicycle is a complex structure. The wheel assembly has these parts: <randomList listItemPrefix="pf01">
    *   `listItem`: the tire
    *   `listItem`: the tube
    *   `listItem`: the spokes
    *   `listItem`: the spoke nipples
    *   `listItem`: the valve
    *   `listItem`: the hub
    </randomList> On their own, the individual components are not very strong. But, when they are installed together, the components make the complete wheel (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0001" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>). The complete wheel is resistant to almost any type of heavy loads and operation.

*   **levelledPara** (id="par-0001"):
    *   **title:** Spokes
    *   **para:** The spokes go out from the hub and go across and below each other. The spoke nipples attach the spokes to the rim with the threads on the end of the spokes. You can use the spoke nipples to adjust the tension of the spokes. The tension on each of the spokes must be equal.

*   **levelledPara** (id="par-0002"):
    *   **title:** Wheel rim
    *   **para:** The rim (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0002" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>) of the wheel has a lining of rim tape. This tape protects the tube from damage that the rough edges on the spoke nipples can cause.

        *   **graphic:** infoEntityIdent="ICN-C0419-S1000D0366-001-01", reproductionWidth="510pt"

*   **levelledPara** (id="par-0003"):
    *   **title:** Tube and tire
    *   **para:** The tube and the tire install on the rim. The sidewalls of the tire have markings on them. These which are used to indicate the correct direction of rotation. The markings also make sure the tire installs on the rim and that the directional arrows points in the correct direction. You install the tube into the tire before you inflate it. The tube has a valve (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0003" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>) which you put through the hole in the rim. This valve (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0003" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>) is used to inflate the tube and the tire to the correct pressure. A dust cap installs on the valve (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0003" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>) to prevent damage that dust and debris can cause.
