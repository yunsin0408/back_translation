# Product Manual (PM)

## Content

This document outlines the content of a product manual.  It details various references to components and their configurations.

### Referenced Applicables (Applications)

The following applicables are referenced within the content:

*   **app-001:**  (Multiple references throughout - appears to be a common default)
*   **app-002:** (Frequently referenced, likely a core component set)
*   **app-003:** (Several references, potentially a supplemental or optional component)
*   **app-004:** (Limited references, possibly a specialized component)

### Detailed Content Breakdown

The content is structured around a single `pmEntry`.  This entry contains a series of `dmRef` (Data Management References) which link to specific configurations of a product identified by `S1000DLIGHTING`. 

#### `pmEntry` Details

*   The `pmEntry` covers a broad range of configurations, indicated by the variety of `infoCode` values.
*   `disassyCode` values (00, 01, 02) suggest different assemblies or sub-assemblies.
*   `itemLocationCode` values (A, D) likely denote physical locations/installations within the product.
*   `issueNumber` indicates revisions or versions of the documentation/configurations.
*   `language` is consistently `en` (English) with `countryCode` of `US`.

#### `dmRef` Examples (Illustrative - not exhaustive)

The following are examples of the `dmRef` structures.  Each represents a specific configuration.

*   **`dmRef` with `app-001`:**
    *   `infoCode`: 341
    *   `issueNumber`: 010
    *   `itemLocationCode`: A
*   **`dmRef` with `app-002`:**
    *   `infoCode`: 413
    *   `issueNumber`: 010
    *   `itemLocationCode`: A
*   **`dmRef` with `app-003`:**
    *   `infoCode`: 0A1
    *   `issueNumber`: 004
    *   `itemLocationCode`: D
*   **`dmRef` with `app-004`:**
    *   `infoCode`: 0A2
    *   `issueNumber`: 004
    *   `itemLocationCode`: D

#### Key Observations

*   The documentation appears to be relatively comprehensive, covering a wide range of configurations.
*   The use of `infoCode`, `disassyCode`, and `itemLocationCode` provides a granular level of control and configuration management.
*   The consistent use of language and country code suggests a standardized documentation process.
*   The high number of `dmRef` entries indicates a complex product with many possible variations.

This structure enables detailed tracking and management of product configurations throughout the lifecycle.
