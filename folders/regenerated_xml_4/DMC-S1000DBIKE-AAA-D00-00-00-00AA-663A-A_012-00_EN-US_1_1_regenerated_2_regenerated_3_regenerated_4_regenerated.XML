  <procedureSteps>
    <step>Remove the rear wheel. (Refer to &lt;dmRef modelIdentCode="S1000DBIKE" systemDiffCode="AAA" systemCode="DA0" subSystemCode="2" subSubSystemCode="0" assyCode="00" disassyCode="00" disassyCodeVariant="AA" infoCode="520" infoCodeVariant="A"/&gt;)</step>
    <step>Ensure there is no air remaining in the tube.</step>
    <step>Loosen the cap on the valve stem.</step>
    <step>Push the valve stem core down to bleed all air.</step>
    <step>Use a tire lever to move the tire bead out of its seat, lifting it above the rim lip.</step>
    <step>Remove the tube.</step>
    <step>Inflate the tube slightly with the foot pump.</step>
    <step>Examine the tube for leaks.</step>
    <step>Identify any leaks with a circle drawn using the marker pen.</step>
    <step>Release most of the air from the tube.</step>
    <step>Use sandpaper from the tube patch kit to roughen the area around the puncture.</step>
    <step>Apply a thin layer of glue from the patch kit over the roughened area, ensuring it's larger than the puncture.</step>
    <step>Allow the glue to dry for approximately five minutes, until it becomes tacky and dull.</step>
    <step>Remove the protective foil from the patch.</step>
    <step>Apply the patch over the glue, centering it on the puncture.</step>
    <step>Press firmly from the center of the patch outwards, ensuring good adhesion.</step>
    <step>Remove the thin cover from the patch.</step>
    <step>Apply a light dusting of talcum powder around the patch.</step>
    <step>Slightly inflate the repaired tube with the foot pump.</step>
    <step>Starting at the valve stem, carefully install the tube between the tire and the rim.</step>
    <step>Push the valve stem through the hole in the rim, ensuring it is straight.</step>
    <step>Install the remaining portion of the tire onto the rim.</step>
    <step>Reinstall the wheel onto the bicycle.</step>
