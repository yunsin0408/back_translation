    <title>Introduction to Bicycles</title>
    <p>A bicycle, also called a bike or cycle, is a human-powered, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other.</p>

    <subsection id="frame-and-fork">
      <title>Frame and Fork</title>
      <p>The frame and fork are the main structural components of a bicycle. The frame provides the base structure for attaching various components, while the fork holds the front wheel.</p>

    <subsection id="wheels-and-tires">
      <title>Wheels and Tires</title>
      <p>Bicycles have two wheels, with the front wheel being steered by the handlebars. Tires provide traction and cushioning between the wheel and the ground.</p>

    <subsection id="braking-system">
      <title>Braking System</title>
      <p>The braking system allows riders to slow down or stop their bicycles. It typically consists of brake levers, cables, calipers, and brake pads.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="gearing-system">
      <title>Gearing System</title>
      <p>The gearing system enables cyclists to adjust the difficulty of pedaling based on terrain conditions. This includes components such as chain rings, sprockets, derailleurs, and shifters.</p>

    <title>Bicycle History</title>
    <p>The history of bicycles dates back to 1817 when German Baron Karl von Drais invented the first two-wheeled, human-powered vehicle. Over the years, significant innovations have transformed the bicycle into its modern forms, including the introduction of pedals, chains, pneumatic tires, and derailleur gears.</p>
