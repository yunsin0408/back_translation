    <title>Learning Plan</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>This learning plan outlines the strategy for improving the performance of bike couriers at Speedy Courier. The plan focuses on creating a computer-based training program that works in conjunction with hands-on practical exercises.</p>
    </introduction>
    <performanceAnalysis>
        <currentStatus>
            <p>The current status of bike couriers is that they lack the necessary skills to perform routine maintenance and repairs on their bikes, leading to decreased productivity and increased downtime.</p>
        </currentStatus>
        <rootCauseAnalysis>
            <p>The root cause of this problem is a lack of training and resources for bike couriers. Currently, there is no structured training program in place to teach bike couriers how to perform routine maintenance and repairs.</p>

        <computerBasedTrainingProgram>
            <p>The computer-based training program will cover the following topics:</p>
            <topics>
                <topic>Steering system maintenance and repair</topic>
                <topic>Brake system maintenance and repair</topic>
                <topic>Gear system maintenance and repair</topic>
                <topic>Tire maintenance and repair</topic>
            </topics>
            <p>The program will include interactive modules, videos, and quizzes to engage learners and assess their knowledge.</p>
        </computerBasedTrainingProgram>
        <handsOnPracticalExercises>
            <p>Hands-on practical exercises will be conducted in a controlled environment, where bike couriers can practice the skills they learned in the computer-based training program. The exercises will cover the following topics:</p>
            <topics>
                <topic>Removing and installing steering system parts</topic>
                <topic>Adjusting brake systems</topic>
                <topic>Repairing gear systems</topic>
                <topic>Changing tires</topic>
            </topics>

    </interventionDefinition>
    <interventionImplementation>
        <creationOfTrainingProgram>
            <p>The creation of the training program will involve the development of interactive modules, videos, and quizzes. The program will be designed to be engaging and easy to use.</p>
        </creationOfTrainingProgram>
        <institutionOfTrainingProgram>
            <p>The institution of the training program will involve the rollout of the program to all bike couriers at Speedy Courier. The program will be mandatory for all new hires, and existing employees will be required to complete the program within a specified timeframe.</p>
        </institutionOfTrainingProgram>
    </interventionImplementation>
    <performanceEvaluation>
        <formativeEvaluation>
            <p>The formative evaluation will be conducted using surveys to assess the effectiveness of the training program. The surveys will be administered at regular intervals to gather feedback from learners and identify areas for improvement.</p>
        </formativeEvaluation>
        <summativeEvaluation>
            <p>The summative evaluation will be conducted using surveys as well as the analysis of assessment results. The evaluation will assess the impact of the training program on learner performance and organizational outcomes.</p>
