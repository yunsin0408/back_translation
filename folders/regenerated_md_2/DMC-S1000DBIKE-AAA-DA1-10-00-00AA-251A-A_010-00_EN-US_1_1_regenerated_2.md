This input consists of repeated `<dmIndent>` tags.  Since these tags have no inherent meaning in markdown, and are simply repeating, I'm interpreting this as a request for a clean, empty markdown document.  It's a bit of an odd request, but here it is:

```markdown
# Empty Document

This document is intentionally blank. The original input consisted of repeated `<dmIndent>` tags and was interpreted as a request for a clean, empty markdown file.
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`# Empty Document`**:  A top-level heading.
*   **The paragraph**: Provides context for why the document is empty.  This fulfills the request by acknowledging the unusual input and explaining the outcome.

If you had a *different* intent with the repeated `<dmIndent>`, please provide further instructions, and I'll do my best to generate the desired markdown.  For example, if these were intended to represent indentation levels, or some other specific formatting request, please explain.
