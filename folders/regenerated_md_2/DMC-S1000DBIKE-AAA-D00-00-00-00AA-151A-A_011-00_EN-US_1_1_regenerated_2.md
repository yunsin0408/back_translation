This appears to be a fragment of XML or a similar structured data format, repeated many times.  It's very difficult to interpret without knowing the schema or context. However, I can provide a basic markdown representation, assuming the tags within `<dmAddress>` represent key-value pairs.  I'll treat each repeated block as an individual entry.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Missing Context:** I'm making *assumptions* about the meaning of the tags.  A proper interpretation requires knowing what each tag represents.
* **No Data:** All I see are tags, not actual values *within* those tags.  If there were data, I'd include it.
* **Repetition:** The repetition is overwhelming and makes the document unreadable.  I'll show one example entry, and then indicate the repetition.

```markdown
## Address Entry Example

This represents one of many repeated address entries.  Without the actual data *inside* the tags, it's a structural representation only.

```
<dmAddress>
  <!-- Tag names and potential data would go here -->
</dmAddress>
```

**Repetition:**

The above `<dmAddress>` block is repeated *many* times (hundreds, based on the provided text).  A complete representation would be extremely long and unhelpful.  

**Possible Interpretation (with assumptions):**

If the tags within `<dmAddress>` represented fields like `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, etc., the complete document would be a list of addresses.

**To provide a more useful markdown document, please provide:**

1.  **The schema or definition of the `<dmAddress>` tag and its child tags.**  What does each tag represent?
2.  **A small example of the *complete* XML/data with actual values inside the tags.** This will allow me to understand the data structure and create a meaningful markdown representation.
3.  **What you intend to *do* with this data.** (e.g., create a table, generate a list, etc.) This will help me format the markdown appropriately.
