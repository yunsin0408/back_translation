## Content

### Introduction

This data module describes the drivetrain of a bicycle.

### Drivetrain Components

#### Crankset

The crankset is the assembly that converts the rider's pedaling force into rotational force.

#### Cassette

The cassette is the set of sprockets on the rear wheel that provides different gear ratios.

#### Chain

The chain connects the crankset to the cassette and transfers power from the pedals to the rear wheel.

#### Derailleurs

Derailleurs are mechanisms that move the chain between different sprockets on the crankset and cassette.

### Maintenance

Regular maintenance is essential to keep the drivetrain in good working order.

#### Cleaning

The drivetrain should be cleaned regularly to remove dirt and grime.

#### Lubrication

The drivetrain should be lubricated regularly to reduce friction and wear.

#### Adjustment

The derailleurs should be adjusted regularly to ensure smooth shifting.
