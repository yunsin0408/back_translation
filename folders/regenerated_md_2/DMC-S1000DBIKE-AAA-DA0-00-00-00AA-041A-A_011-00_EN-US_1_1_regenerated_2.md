#### The bicycle wheel

*   **title**: The bicycle wheel
*   **para**: The wheel (refer to [fig-0001](fig-0001)) of a bicycle is a complex structure. The wheel assembly has these parts:
    *   pf01: the tire
    *   pf01: the tube
    *   pf01: the spokes
    *   pf01: the spoke nipples
    *   pf01: the valve
    *   pf01: the hub
    On their own, the individual components are not very strong. But, when they are installed together, the components make the complete wheel (refer to [fig-0001](fig-0001)). The complete wheel is resistant to almost any type of heavy loads and operation.

#### Figure: Parts of the wheel

*   **title**: Parts of the wheel
*   **graphic**: infoEntityIdent="ICN-C0419-S1000D0365-001-01" reproductionWidth="510pt"

#### Wheel Spokes

*   **title**: Wheel Spokes
*   **para**: Wheel spokes are the wires that connect the hub to the rim. They provide the strength and rigidity of the wheel. Spokes are typically made of stainless steel, but can also be made of aluminum or carbon fiber.

#### Wheel Rim

*   **title**: Wheel Rim
*   **para**: The wheel rim is the outer edge of the wheel that holds the tire. Rims are typically made of aluminum, but can also be made of carbon fiber or steel.

#### Wheel Hub

*   **title**: Wheel Hub
*   **para**: The wheel hub is the center of the wheel that connects it to the bicycle. The hub contains bearings that allow the wheel to spin smoothly.
