# Bicycle Component Overview

This document provides an overview of the key components of a bicycle. It includes descriptions and references to visual aids within a larger technical manual.

## Visual Aid References

The following figures are referenced throughout this document:

*   **Figure 1:** Overall Bicycle Diagram
*   **Figure 1.1:** Frame Detail
*   **Figure 1.2:** Wheel Assembly
*   **Figure 1.3:** Seat and Seat Post

## Key Components

### Frame (Refer to Figure 1.1)

The bicycle frame is the main structural component, typically constructed from metal tubes welded together. It provides the foundation for all other parts.

### Wheels (Refer to Figure 1.2)

The wheels enable movement and consist of the following parts:

*   **Hub:** The central part of the wheel.
*   **Spokes:** Connect the hub to the rim.
*   **Metal Rim:** The outer circular part of the wheel.
*   **Rubber Tire:** Provides traction and cushioning.

### Seat and Seat Post (Refer to Figure 1.3)

The seat and seat post provide a comfortable riding position. The seat post inserts into the seat tube, allowing for height adjustment.

### Handlebar and Stem (Refer to Figure 1.4)

The handlebar and stem control steering and provide a mounting point for brake levers and shifters.

### Cranks (Refer to Figure 1.5)

The cranks are levers that extend from the bottom bracket to the pedals, transferring pedaling force to the drivetrain.

### Pedals (Refer to Figure 1.6)

The pedals are platforms for the feet, attaching to the cranks and receiving pedaling force.

### Chain and Gears (Refer to Figure 1.7)

The chain and gear system (drivetrain) transmit power from the pedals to the rear wheel. Key components include:

*   **Front Chain Ring:** The large gear attached to the crank.
*   **Rear Freewheel (or Cassette):** The set of gears on the rear wheel.
*   **Front and Rear Derailleurs:** Mechanisms that move the chain between gears.
*   **Shift Lever:** Controls the derailleurs.
*   **Cables:** Connect the shift lever to the derailleurs.

### Brakes (Refer to Figure 1.8)

The brake system provides stopping power and includes:

*   **Actuators (on Handlebars):** Levers operated by the rider.
*   **Brake Cable:** Transmits force from the actuator to the brakes.
*   **Brake Calipers:** Clamp onto the wheel rim or rotor.
*   **Brake Pads:** Provide friction to slow or stop the wheel.
