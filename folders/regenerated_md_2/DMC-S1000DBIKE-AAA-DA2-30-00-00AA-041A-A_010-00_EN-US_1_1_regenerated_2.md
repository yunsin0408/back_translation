*   A headset has cups that are pushed into the head tube and a ring on the fork. All three must be fully parallel. It is usually necessary to remove rough paint to get all three fully parallel.
*   A clamp bolt holds the stem to the steerer tube.
*   The upper race installs onto the steerer tube with a thread. A locknut is used to safety the upper race.
*   The fourth remaining bearing race is part of a nut that installs on the threaded top end of the fork. This is done after you install it in the head tube. It is sometimes necessary for some headsets to have more thread at the top of the head tube. If the fork is too long, the spacer rings can be installed. If it is too short, there is a limit to the number of headsets you can use.
