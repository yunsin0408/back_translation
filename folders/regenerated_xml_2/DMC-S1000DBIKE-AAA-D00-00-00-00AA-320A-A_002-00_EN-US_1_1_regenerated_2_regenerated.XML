  <title>Bike Pre-Ride Check - Check List</title>
  <introduction>
    <para>This document details a pre-ride check list to ensure bicycle safety and proper functionality. Following these steps before each ride will minimize the risk of mechanical failure and enhance rider safety.</para>
  </introduction>
  <tools_equipment_required>
    <item>None (basic visual inspection &amp; manual checks)</item>
    <item>(Optional) Tire pressure gauge</item>
    <item>(Optional) Torque wrench (for fasteners - refer to component specifications)</item>
  </tools_equipment_required>
  <pre_ride_check_procedure>
    <para>This procedure is organized into numbered steps. Each step includes indication conditions (normal and abnormal) and associated actions if abnormalities are detected.</para>
    <step>
      <number>1</number>
      <title>General Condition</title>
      <action>Check the overall condition of the bike before every ride.</action>
      <normal>No immediate issues observed.</normal>
      <abnormal>Any visible damage or unusual wear.</abnormal>
      <remedy>Address any concerns before riding.</remedy>
    </step>
    <step>
      <number>2</number>
      <title>Fastener Check</title>
      <action>Check all fasteners (bolts, nuts, quick releases) for tightness.</action>
      <normal>All fasteners are secure and tight.</normal>
      <abnormal>Fasteners are loose.</abnormal>
      <warning>Incorrect tightening force can result in component failure, leading to loss of control.</warning>
      <remedy>Tighten and torque fastener according to specific maintenance instruction for the related component.</remedy>
    </step>
    <step>
      <number>3</number>
      <title>Bounce Test</title>
      <action>Lift the front wheel off the ground 2-3 inches and bounce it on the ground.</action>
      <normal>Nothing rattles or appears loose.</normal>
      <abnormal>Bike rattles or parts appear loose.</abnormal>
      <remedy>Secure the loose part according to the specific maintenance instruction for the related part.</remedy>
    </step>
    <step>
      <number>4</number>
      <title>Tire Pressure Check</title>
      <action>Check tire pressure.</action>
      <normal>Tire pressure is correct according to the specification printed on the tire sidewall.</normal>
      <abnormal>Tire pressure is outside the specified range.</abnormal>
      <high_pressure>Bleed air from the tire until it reaches the maximum pressure printed on the sidewall.</high_pressure>
      <low_pressure>Add air to the tire, not exceeding the maximum pressure printed on the sidewall.</low_pressure>
    </step>
    <step>
      <number>5</number>
      <title>Tire Inspection</title>
      <action>Inspect the tire for cuts or cracks.</action>
      <normal>Tire has no cuts or cracks.</normal>
      <abnormal>Tire has visible damage.</abnormal>
      <warning>Riding on a damaged tire could cause tire failure, leading to loss of control.</warning>
      <remedy>Replace the tire before riding.</remedy>
    </step>
    <step>
      <number>6</number>
      <title>Wheel Trueness Check</title>
      <action>Spin each wheel and observe for wobble.</action>
      <normal>Wheels spin true without wobble.</normal>
      <abnormal>Wheels wobble when spinning.</abnormal>
      <caution>Wheels must be true for rim brakes to work effectively.</caution>
      <remedy>Have the bike serviced to true the wheels.</remedy>
    </step>
    <step>
      <number>7</number>
      <title>Rim Inspection</title>
      <action>Inspect tire rims for wear.</action>
      <normal>No wear indicator marks are visible on the rim.</normal>
      <abnormal>Wear indicator marks are visible on the rim.</abnormal>
      <warning>Riding on a rim at the end of its life can result in wheel failure and loss of control.</warning>
      <remedy>Replace the wheel.</remedy>
    </step>
    <step>
      <number>8</number>
      <title>Brake Check</title>
      <action>Squeeze both brake levers.</action>
      <normal>Front and rear brakes securely grip the wheel rim. Brake lever movement is within 1 inch.</normal>
      <abnormal>
        <condition>Brakes do not close fully</condition>
        <remedy>Tighten brakes according to maintenance procedure. Check/replace brake cables if necessary.</remedy>
        <condition>Brake lever movement exceeds 1 inch</condition>
        <remedy>Tighten brakes according to maintenance procedure.</remedy>
      </abnormal>
