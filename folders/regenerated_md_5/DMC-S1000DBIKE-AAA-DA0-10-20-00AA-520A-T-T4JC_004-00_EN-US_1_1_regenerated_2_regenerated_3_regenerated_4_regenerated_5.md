### Learning

#### Learning Content
*   **Title:** Front Wheel Removal
*   **Description:** The content of this data model describes the steps for removing the bicycle front wheel.

##### LC Instruction

*   **Paragraph ID: para-001**
    *   **Content:** To remove your bike's front wheel, place the bike on a stand. If you do not have a stand, you can still remove the tire. It will just take a little coordination on your part. Begin by either deflating the front tire slightly or disconnecting the front brakes. This is done so the wheel can come out easily and not get stuck at the brake pads.
