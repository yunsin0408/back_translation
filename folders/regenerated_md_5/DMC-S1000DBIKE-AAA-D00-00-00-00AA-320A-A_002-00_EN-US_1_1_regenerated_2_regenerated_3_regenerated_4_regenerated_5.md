This document details a pre-ride check list to ensure bicycle safety and proper functionality. Following these steps before each ride will minimize the risk of mechanical failure and enhance rider safety.

## 1. Tools & Equipment Required

*   None (basic visual inspection & manual checks)
*   (Optional) Tire pressure gauge
*   (Optional) Torque wrench (for fasteners - refer to component specifications)

## 2. Pre-Ride Check Procedure

This procedure is organized into numbered steps. Each step includes indication conditions (normal and abnormal) and associated actions if abnormalities are detected.

## 3. Step-by-Step Checks

### 3.1. Step 1: General Condition

*   **Action:** Check the overall condition of the bike before every ride.
*   **Normal:** No immediate issues observed.
*   **Abnormal:** Any visible damage or unusual wear.
*   **Remedy:** Address any concerns before riding.

### 3.2. Step 2: Fastener Check

*   **Action:** Check all fasteners (bolts, nuts, quick releases) for tightness.
*   **Normal:** All fasteners are secure and tight.
*   **Abnormal:** Fasteners are loose.
*   **Warning:** Incorrect tightening force can result in component failure, leading to loss of control.
*   **Remedy:** Tighten and torque fastener according to specific maintenance instruction for the related component.

### 3.3. Step 3: Bounce Test

*   **Action:** Lift the front wheel off the ground 2-3 inches and bounce it on the ground.
*   **Normal:** Nothing rattles or appears loose.
*   **Abnormal:** Bike rattles or parts appear loose.
*   **Remedy:** Secure the loose part according to the specific maintenance instruction for the related part.

### 3.4. Step 4: Tire Pressure Check

*   **Action:** Check tire pressure.
*   **Normal:** Tire pressure is correct according to the specification printed on the tire sidewall.
*   **Abnormal:** Tire pressure is outside the specified range.
*   **High Pressure:** Bleed air from the tire until it reaches the maximum pressure printed on the sidewall.
*   **Low Pressure:** Add air to the tire, not exceeding the maximum pressure printed on the sidewall.

### 3.5. Step 5: Tire Inspection

*   **Action:** Inspect the tire for cuts or cracks.
*   **Normal:** Tire has no cuts or cracks.
*   **Abnormal:** Tire has visible damage.
*   **Warning:** Riding on a damaged tire could cause tire failure, leading to loss of control.
*   **Remedy:** Replace the tire before riding.

### 3.6. Step 6: Wheel Trueness Check

*   **Action:** Spin each wheel and observe for wobble.
*   **Normal:** Wheels spin true without wobble.
*   **Abnormal:** Wheels wobble when spinning.
*   **Caution:** Wheels must be true for rim brakes to work effectively.
*   **Remedy:** Have the bike serviced to true the wheels.

### 3.7. Step 7: Rim Inspection

*   **Action:** Inspect tire rims for wear.
*   **Normal:** No wear indicator marks are visible on the rim.
*   **Abnormal:** Wear indicator marks are visible on the rim.
*   **Warning:** Riding on a rim at the end of its life can result in wheel failure and loss of control.
*   **Remedy:** Replace the wheel.

### 3.8. Step 8: Brake Check

*   **Action:** Squeeze both brake levers.
*   **Normal:** Front and rear brakes securely grip the wheel rim. Brake lever movement is within 1 inch.
*   **Abnormal:**

    *   **Condition:** Brakes do not close fully
        **Remedy:** Tighten brakes according to maintenance procedure. Check/replace brake cables if necessary.
    *   **Condition:** Brake lever movement exceeds 1 inch
        **Remedy:** Tighten brakes according to maintenance procedure.
