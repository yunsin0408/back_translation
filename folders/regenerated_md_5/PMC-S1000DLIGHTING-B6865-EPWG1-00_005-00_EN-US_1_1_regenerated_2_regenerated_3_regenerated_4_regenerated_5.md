*   app-003: (Several references, potentially a supplemental or optional component)
*   app-004: (Limited references, possibly a specialized component)

### Heading: Detailed Content Breakdown

The content is structured around a single `pmEntry`. This entry contains a series of `dmRef` (Data Management References) which link to specific configurations of a product identified by `S1000DLIGHTING`.

### Heading: pmEntry Details

*   The `pmEntry` covers a broad range of configurations, indicated by the variety of `infoCode` values.
*   `disassyCode` values (00, 01, 02) suggest different assemblies or sub-assemblies.
*   `itemLocationCode` values (A, D) likely denote physical locations/installations within the product.

### Heading: dmRef Examples (Illustrative - not exhaustive)

### Heading: Key Observations

*   The documentation appears to be relatively comprehensive, covering a wide range of configurations.
*   The use of `infoCode`, `disassyCode`, and `itemLocationCode` provides a granular level of control and configuration management.
*   The consistent use of language and country code suggests a standardized documentation process.
*   The high number of `dmRef` entries indicates a complex product with many possible variations.

The structure enables detailed tracking and management of product configurations throughout the lifecycle.
