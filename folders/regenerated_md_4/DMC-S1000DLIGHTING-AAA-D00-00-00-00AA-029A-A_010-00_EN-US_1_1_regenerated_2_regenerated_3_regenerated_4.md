#### Wiring Fields

*   **descrWire:**

| Field Name | Description |
|---|---|
| Field Name | Description of the field. (Repeated for each field) |
| Wire | Contains the sequential number of the wire, e.g. in the harness. |
| Harness ident | Harness ident identifies pre-assembled wires, which are installed on the bicycle. |
| Wire sequential number | Contains the sequential number of the wire, e.g. in the harness. |
| Wire information circuit code | Contains the identifier of the circuit to which the wire belongs. |
| Wire information wire section identification | Contains the identifier of the section to which the wire belongs. |
| Length | Length identifies the length of the wire. The given value is approximately 10% higher than necessary to install the wire on the bicycle. |
| Color | Color identifies the color of the wire sheating. |
| Twisting | Twistig identifies wires, which are twisted together with a unique identifier. |
| Electric ident | Electric ident shows the electrical identification, to which the wire is connected. It is available for all electrical equipment, eg L1. |
| Contact | Contact identifies the electrical contact to which the wire is connected. |
| Group code | Identifies wires, which are connected to the same terminal lug. |
| Screens | Screens identifies all screens that shield the wire. Wires shielded by the same screen are identified by the same screens value. |
| Responsible partner company | The responsible partner company indicates the company responsible for the integration of the wire to the bicycle. |
| Feed-through | Identifies bunges through which the wire is routed. |
| Next higher assembly | Identifies the next higher assenbly, in which the wire is installed. |
