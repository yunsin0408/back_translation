## Main Procedure

### Step 1: Brake Inspection

*   **Title:** Brake Inspection
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Open the brake quick release.
    *   Examine the condition and thickness of the brake pads.
        *   **Sub-Step:** Ensure sufficient rubber remains.
        *   **Sub-Step:** Verify the pads are not overly hardened.
    *   Clean any unwanted material from the brake surfaces.

### Step 2: Brake Installation Check

*   **Title:** Brake Installation Check
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Check the hydraulic brake system function (refer to multimedia object: Hydraulic brake function - infoEntityIdent: ICN-C0419-S1000D0384-001-01).
    *   Ensure sufficient clearance exists between the brake pads and the inner diameter of the brake surface.
*   **Caution:** If the pads are too low on the rim (as shown in Figure 1 - ICN-C0419-S1000D0382-001-01), they may cause spoke separation. Ensure pads are correctly installed in the center.

### Step 3: Tire Pressure Check

*   **Title:** Tire Pressure Check
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Check the tire pressure using the tire pressure gauge.
    *   Compare the reading to the recommended pressure indicated on the tire sidewall.
    *   Add air as needed.

### Step 4: Wheel Inspection

*   **Title:** Wheel Inspection
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Examine the rims for bulges and dents.
    *   Inspect for splits at the seam of extruded rims.

### Step 5: Headset Bearing Check

*   **Title:** Headset Bearing Check
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Straddle the bicycle.
    *   Apply the front brakes.
    *   Push the handlebars forward.
    *   Verify the headset bearings are tight.

### Step 6: Chain Check

*   **Title:** Chain Check
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Visually examine the chain condition.
        *   **Sub-Step:** If dirty, clean the chain (refer to document: DA4, 1, 0, 0, 0, B).
    *   Visually inspect for frozen or stiff chain links.
    *   Apply lubricant as needed.
    *   Check chain tension.
        *   **Sub-Step:** Move the chain onto the largest chain ring.
        *   **Sub-Step:** Pull the chain away from the front of the chain ring.
        *   **Sub-Step:** Ensure the play is minimal (less than a full tooth).
        *   **Sub-Step:** Tighten the chain using the specialist toolset.
