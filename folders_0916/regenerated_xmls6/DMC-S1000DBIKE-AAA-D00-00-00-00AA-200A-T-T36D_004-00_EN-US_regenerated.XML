                        <paragraph>Regular cleaning and testing of your bike's systems are part of keeping your bike maintained. Over time, your bike's moving parts become susceptible to dirt and grime and will eventually fail to operate correctly if they are not maintained. Because the bike has so many moving parts, it is important that you know how to keep the bike clean and lubricated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is also important to know how to patch an inner tube puncture. As you are riding, you never know what you might run over. A nail or a tack can cause quite a bit of aggravation.</paragraph>
