Learning Plan
================

### Overview

This learning plan outlines the creation and institution of a computer-based training program that works in conjunction with hands-on practical exercises.

### Performance Analysis
#### Problem Statement

The current problem is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that there is a need for a computer-based training program to improve the performance of bike couriers or maintenance personnel.

#### Cause Analysis

The cause analysis is also not explicitly stated. However, based on the provided information, it appears that the lack of proper training and knowledge about bike maintenance may be contributing to the problem.

### Learning Objectives
Although the original text does not contain a `lcLearningObjectives` section, we can infer some possible learning objectives for the Basic Bike Awareness course:

* Identify the parts of a bike's steering system.
* Describe the steps for installing and removing a bike's steering system.
* Perform steps to remove and install the parts of a bike's steering system.

### Intervention Definition
#### Training Interventions

The training intervention will comprise of a computer-based training program that works in conjunction with hands-on practical exercises. The program will include:

* A steering system lesson
* An installation and removal lesson
* Practical exercises to reinforce learning

#### Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for the training program include:

* Adobe Flash Player
* Acrobat Acrobat Reader
* 1024x768 resolution for optimal viewing
* File sizes kept below 100k with pre-loaders attached as needed

### Intervention Implementation
The implementation of this intervention will comprise of the creation and institution of a computer-based training program that works in conjunction with hands-on practical exercises.

### Performance Evaluation
#### Formative Evaluation

The formative evaluation will be conducted using surveys to assess the effectiveness of the training program during its development and implementation.

#### Summative Evaluation

The summative evaluation will be conducted using surveys as well as analysis of assessment results to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the training program after its completion.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this learning plan outlines a comprehensive approach to creating and implementing a computer-based training program for bike couriers or maintenance personnel. The program includes a combination of theoretical and practical exercises to ensure that learners have a thorough understanding of bike maintenance procedures.
