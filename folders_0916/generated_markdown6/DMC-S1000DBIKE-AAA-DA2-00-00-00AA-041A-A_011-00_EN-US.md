## Content
### Description
#### Introduction to Steering
The steering on the bike is what enables the bike to manoeuvre in a given direction during travel. The steering system on the bike is made of three parts, they are:
1. **Handlebar**
2. **Headset**
3. **Stem**

##### Handlebar
This consists of a horizontal bar attached to the stem with handgrips at the end. Brake levers and shifters are also attached to this bar although they do not have any part in the steering mechanism. The handlebars manoeuvrability is a sideways swivelling action. The handlebars themselves do not provide this swivelling, the headset (also known as the steering tube) is the mechanism that enables the handlebars to swivel.

##### Headset
This mechanism is situated in front of the frame and connects the front fork to the stem and handlebars. The headset allows the handlebars to swivel left and right for steering purposes.
For a full description of the headset, refer to the [Headset Description](#headset).

##### Stem
The stem is a piece that attaches the handlebar to the steering tube. Basically the stem is just a threaded stem bolt situated inside the steerer tube and is what attaches the handlebars to the headset.
