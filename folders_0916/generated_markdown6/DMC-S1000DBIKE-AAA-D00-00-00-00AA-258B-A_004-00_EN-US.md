# DModule Content
## Introduction
The provided XML content appears to be a part of an S1000D documentation module. This document outlines the procedure for cleaning and maintaining a bicycle.

## Procedure Overview
The procedure involves several steps:
1. Cleaning the bicycle with water to remove dirt.
2. Using a brush to access hard-to-reach areas, such as shift levers, knobbly tires, and brakes.
3. Removing caked grime from the chain and sprockets using a screwdriver.
4. Degreasing the freewheel assembly using a specified degreaser.
5. Flushing the sprockets, derailleurs, chain rings, and chain with water.

## Detailed Procedure
### Step 1: Clean the Bicycle
* Use water to remove all dirt from the bicycle.
* Refer to [Figure 1: Cleaning the Bike](#figure-1) for more information.

### Step 2: Access Hard-to-Reach Areas
* Use a brush (e.g., [seq-0002](#support-equipment)) to access areas that are not easy to clean, such as:
	+ Shift levers
	+ Knobbly tires
	+ Brakes

### Step 3: Remove Caked Grime
* Clean the caked grime from the chain and sprockets using a screwdriver with a small blade.

### Step 4: Degrease the Freewheel Assembly
* Use [sup-0001](#degreaser) to degrease the freewheel assembly as shown in [Figure 2: Degreasing the Freehub](#figure-2).
* Remove grease from parts such as:
	+ Sprockets
	+ Guide and tension wheels of the derailleur
	+ Chain ring teeth

### Step 5: Flush with Water
* Flush the sprockets, derailleurs, chain rings, and chain with water.
* If necessary, repeat the flush procedure.

## Alternate Procedures for Specific Bicycle Models
Depending on the bicycle model (e.g., [app-0002](#bicycle-models) or [app-0001](#bicycle-models)), alternative steps may be taken:
### For Model app-0002
1. Soak a sponge ([seq-0003](#support-equipment)) in [sup-0002](#detergent) and water.
2. Clean the bicycle with the soaked sponge.
3. Flush the bicycle to remove all detergent.
4. Move the bicycle up and down on its tires to remove excess water.

### For Model app-0001
1. Soak a sponge ([seq-0003](#support-equipment)) in [sup-0003](#detergent) and water.
2. Clean the bicycle with the soaked sponge.
3. Soak the sponge again in [sup-0002](#detergent) and water.
4. Fully clean the bicycle with the soaked sponge.
5. Flush the bicycle to remove all detergent.
6. Move the bicycle up and down on its tires to remove excess water.

## Closing Requirements
After completing the procedure:
* Ensure the bicycle is dry.
