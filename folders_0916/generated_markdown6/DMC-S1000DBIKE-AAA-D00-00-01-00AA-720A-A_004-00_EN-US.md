This document can be used as a reference guide for bicycle mechanics or enthusiasts who need to install a new fork on their bicycle. The detailed step-by-step instructions and references to other DM Refs provide a comprehensive understanding of the installation process.

Code Snippets
-------------

The following code snippet shows an example of how to represent a `proceduralStep` in XML:

```xml
<proceduralStep controlAuthorityRefs="controlAuthority-001">
    <para>Apply grease (<internalRef internalRefId="sup-0001" internalRefTargetType="irtt04"/>) on the headset</para>
</proceduralStep>
```

In this example, the `proceduralStep` element has a `controlAuthorityRefs` attribute that references the control authority "controlAuthority-001". The `para` element contains the step instruction, which includes an internal reference to the supply with ID "sup-0001".
