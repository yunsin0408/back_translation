S1000D Brex Module
====================
### Introduction

The S1000D Brex module is an XML-based standard for creating and managing technical documentation. It provides a set of rules and guidelines for structuring and formatting content.

### Context Rules

Context rules define the specific requirements for creating and managing technical documentation within a particular project or context.

#### Structure Object Rule Group

The structure object rule group defines the rules for structuring and organizing content within the Brex module.

*   **Maintenance Task Code**: The task code must be one of the following:
    *   DET: Detailed inspection
    *   DIS: Discard
    *   FNC: Functional Check
    *   GVI: General visual inspection
    *   LUB: Lubrication
    *   OPC: Operational check
    *   RST: Restoration
    *   SVC: Servicing
    *   VCK: Visual check
*   **Limit Type**: The limit type must be one of the following:
    *   Time between overhaul
    *   Hard time
    *   Since last maintenance
    *   Out time limit
    *   On condition
    *   Check maintenance
    *   Functional check
*   **Threshold Unit of Measure**: The unit of measurement for the threshold interval must be one of the following:
    *   Months
    *   Weeks
    *   Years
    *   Days
    *   Shop visits
    *   Auxiliary power unit change
    *   Wheel change
    *   Kilometer

#### Notation Rule List

The notation rule list defines the rules for notations and annotations within the Brex module.

*   **Flash Animation**: Flash animation is not allowed in the project.

### Non-Context Rules

Non-context rules define the general requirements for creating and managing technical documentation that apply across all projects and contexts.

*   **Review and Approval**: Bike data modules must be reviewed and approved by EPWG before publishing.
*   **Concept Sophistication**: The Bike data set must contain examples of how to apply constructs and principles representing various levels of concept sophistication.

Example Use Cases
-----------------

The S1000D Brex module can be used in a variety of applications, including:
