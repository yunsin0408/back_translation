### Content
#### Description
##### The Bicycle Wheel
The wheel (refer to figure 1) of a bicycle is a complex structure. The wheel assembly has these parts:
* the tire
* the tube
* the spokes
* the spoke nipples
* the valve
* the hub
On their own, the individual components are not very strong. But, when they are installed together, the components make the complete wheel (refer to figure 1). The complete wheel is resistant to almost any type of heavy loads and operation.

###### Figure 1: Parts of the Wheel
![Parts of the wheel](ICN-C0419-S1000D0365-001-01)

##### Spokes
The spokes go out from the hub and go across and below each other. The spoke nipples attach the spokes to the rim with the threads on the end of the spokes. You can use the spoke nipples to adjust the tension of the spokes. The tension on each of the spokes must be equal.

##### Wheel Rim
The rim (refer to figure 2) of the wheel has a lining of rim tape. This tape protects the tube from damage that the rough edges on the spoke nipples can cause.

##### Tube and Tire
The tube and the tire install on the rim. The sidewalls of the tire have markings on them. These which are used to indicate the correct direction of rotation. The markings also make sure the tire installs on the rim and that the directional arrows points in the correct direction. You install the tube into the tire before you inflate it. The tube has a valve (refer to figure 3) which you put through the hole in the rim. This valve (refer to figure 3) is used to inflate the tube and the tire to the correct pressure. A dust cap installs on the valve (refer to figure 3) to prevent damage that dust and debris can cause.
