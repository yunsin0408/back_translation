### Description
#### Levelled Para
* **Title:** Brake system
* **Para:** The most important part of the bicycle is the brake system. Only a minimum maintenance of the brake system is necessary. But, when a problem does occur, make sure you to do the necessary maintenance as quickly as possible. If you do not do this the bicycle will be dangerous to use.
* **Para 2:** There are nine different types of brake systems. The one found on most bicycles is the cantilever brake (refer to [par-0001](#par-0001)).
* **Levelled Para:**
	+ **Id:** par-0001
	+ **Title:** Cantilever brake
	+ **Para:** The brake system (refer to [fig-0001](#fig-0001)) has these primary components:
		1. the brake lever (refer to [par-0003](#par-0003))
		2. the brake cable
		3. the brake arm
		4. the brake clamp (also known as callipers)
		5. the brake pads (refer to [par-0002](#par-0002))

* **Levelled Para 2:**
	+ **Id:** par-0002
	+ **Title:** Brake pads
	+ **Para:** There are four brake pads (refer to [fig-0002](#fig-0002)) on the bicycle. Two are found on the front wheel and two on the rear wheel. The brake pads are made out of hard wearing rubber.

* **Levelled Para 3:**
	+ **Id:** par-0003
	+ **Title:** Brake lever
	+ **Para:** The brake levers (refer to [fig-0003](#fig-0003)) are easily damaged. The lever is installed in the mount. A clamp bolt holds the mount. This bolt is not visible because it is found in the mount. The lever turns on a lever pivot bolt. The adjuster lock nut holds the brake cable. This lock nut adjusts the tension of the cable.
