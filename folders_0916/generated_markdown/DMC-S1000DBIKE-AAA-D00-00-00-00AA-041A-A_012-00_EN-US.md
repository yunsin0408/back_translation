# Introduction to Bicycle Parts
=====================================

This document provides an overview of the main parts of a bicycle. It is intended for individuals who are new to bicycles and want to learn more about their components.

## Identifiable Parts of a Bicycle
------------------------------------

The following parts can be immediately identified on a bicycle:

* Frame: The metal tubes that are welded together to form the main structure of the bicycle.
* Wheels: The round structures that rotate when the bicycle is in motion. Each wheel consists of:
	+ Hub
	+ Spokes
	+ Metal rim
	+ Rubber tire
* Seat and seat post: The part of the bicycle where the rider sits, which installs into the seat tube with a mechanism to adjust the height.
* Handle bars: The horizontal bar that attaches to the stem with grips at the ends for the brake levers and shifters.
* Handle bar stem: The part that attaches the handle bar to the steering tube (head set).
* Cranks: The lever that extends from the bottom of the bracket to the pedal.
* Pedals: The platforms for the feet that attach to the crank.
* Chain: The circular set of links that connect the chain ring to the cogs on the freewheel.
* Gears: The components that allow the rider to adjust the difficulty of pedaling. These include:
	+ Front chain ring
	+ Rear freewheel
	+ Front and rear derailleur
	+ Shift lever on the handle bars
	+ Cables
* Brakes: The components that slow or stop the bicycle. These include:
	+ Actuators on the handlebars
	+ Brake cable
	+ Brake callipers
	+ Brake pads
