### Description
* **Levelled Para:**
	+ Title: Gears
	+ Para: The gears include the mechanism, the hubs and the shifters.
	+ Para: The description of the mechanisms is given in [DM Ref](#refs).
	+ Para: The description of the shifters is given in [DM Ref](#refs).
	+ Para: The bicycles of these days can have 27 gears or more. The mountain bikes use a set that includes:
		1. Three socket sprockets of different dimension on the front
		2. Nine socket sprockets of different dimensions at the rear
	+ Para: This set gives the gear ratios.
	+ Para: The shifters installed on the handlebars change the gears and operate the mechanisms (also known as derailleurs). These derailleurs are cable-actuated mechanisms. They move the chain from the different sprockets.
	+ Para: The hub is the center of the wheel and contains the axle and bearings.
	+ Para: The gears let the rider crank at the pedals at a constant movement on slopes of different angles.
