* `<code >itemLocationCode</code>>` values (A, D) likely denote physical locations/installations within the product.
* `<code >issueNumber</code>>` indicates revisions or versions of the documentation/configurations.
* `<code >language</code>>` is consistently `<code >en</code>>` (English) with `<code >countryCode</code>>` of `<code >US</code>>`.

### `<code >dmRef</code>>` Examples (Illustrative - not exhaustive)
The following are examples of the `<code >dmRef</code>>` structures. Each represents a specific configuration.

### Key Observations

* The use of `<code >infoCode</code>>`, `<code >disassyCode</code>>`, and `<code >itemLocationCode</code>>` provides a granular level of control and configuration management.
* The consistent use of language and country code suggests a standardized documentation process.
* The high number of `<code >dmRef</code>>` entries indicates a complex product with many possible variations.

This structure enables detailed tracking and management of product configurations throughout the lifecycle.
