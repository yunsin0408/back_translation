*   randomList
    *   listItem: The index shifters change the gears with a click of a lever.
    *   listItem: The friction shifters hold the derailleur in its position by friction.

#### levelledPara

*   title: How a thumb shifter is made up
*   para: A wing nut (refer to [fig-0002](fig-0002)) from the top of the lever holds the thumb shifter. The lever is on top of the mount and the mount is on the handle bar with a nut. To remove the mount, it is necessary to loosen the nut of two turns (refer to [fig-0003](fig-0003)), then the mount can move from the handle bar from the top of the lever. The lever sits on top of the mount and the mount is fixed into pace on the handle bar by a nut.

*   para: On modern models of this shifter, there is a clamp bolt that holds the shifter in its position (refer to [fig-0004](fig-0004)). The user can loosen the clamp bolt with an applicable tool. This lets the shifter release the handlebar.
