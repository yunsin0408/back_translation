##### title: The bicycle wheel
##### para: The wheel (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0001" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>) of a bicycle is a complex structure. The wheel assembly has these parts:
      - randomList
        - pf01: the tire
        - pf01: the tube
        - pf01: the spokes
        - pf01: the spoke nipples
        - pf01: the valve
        - pf01: the hub
      On their own, the individual components are not very strong. But, when they are installed together, the components make the complete wheel (refer to <internalRef internalRefId="fig-0001" internalRefTargetType="irtt01"/>). The complete wheel is resistant to almost any type of heavy loads and operation.

#### levelPara
##### title: Wheel Rim
##### para: The wheel rim is the outer edge of the wheel that holds the tire. Rims are typically made of aluminum, but can also be made of carbon fiber or steel.

#### levelPara
##### title: Wheel Hub
