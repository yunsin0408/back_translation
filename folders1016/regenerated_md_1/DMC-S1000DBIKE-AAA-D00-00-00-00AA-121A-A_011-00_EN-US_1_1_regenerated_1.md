## Main Procedure

### Step 1

#### Title

Brake Inspection

Open the brake quick release.
Examine the condition and thickness of the brake pads.
#### Sub Step

Ensure sufficient rubber remains.
#### Sub Step

Verify the pads are not overly hardened.
Clean any unwanted material from the brake surfaces.

#### Title

Brake Installation Check

Check the hydraulic brake system function (refer to multimedia object: Hydraulic brake function - infoEntityIdent: ICN-C0419-S1000D0384-001-01).
Ensure sufficient clearance exists between the brake pads and the inner diameter of the brake surface.
#### Caution

If the pads are too low on the rim (as shown in Figure 1 - ICN-C0419-S1000D0382-001-01), they may cause spoke separation. Ensure pads are correctly installed in the center.
### Step 3

#### Title

Tire Pressure Check

Check the tire pressure using the tire pressure gauge.
Compare the reading to the recommended pressure indicated on the tire sidewall.
Add air as needed.
### Step 4

#### Title

Wheel Inspection

Examine the rims for bulges and dents.
Inspect for splits at the seam of extruded rims.
### Step 5

#### Title

If dirty, clean the chain (refer to document: DA4, 1, 0, 0, 0, B).
Visually inspect for frozen or stiff chain links.
Apply lubricant as needed.
Check chain tension.
#### Sub Step

Move the chain onto the largest chain ring.
#### Sub Step

Pull the chain away from the front of the chain ring.
