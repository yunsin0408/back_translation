## Key Components

### Frame (Refer to Figure 1.1)

<p>The bicycle frame is the main structural component, typically constructed from metal tubes welded together. It provides the foundation for all other parts.</p>

### Wheels (Refer to Figure 1.2)

<p>The wheels enable movement and consist of the following parts:</p>

*   **Label:** Hub
    **Description:** The central part of the wheel.
*   **Label:** Spokes
    **Description:** Connect the hub to the rim.
*   **Label:** Metal Rim
    **Description:** The outer circular part of the wheel.
*   **Label:** Rubber Tire
    **Description:** Provides traction and cushioning.

### Seat and Seat Post (Refer to Figure 1.3)

<p>The seat and seat post provide a comfortable riding position. The seat post inserts into the seat tube, allowing for height adjustment.</p>

### Handlebar and Stem (Refer to Figure 1.4)

<p>The handlebar and stem control steering and provide a mounting point for brake levers and shifters.</p>

### Cranks (Refer to Figure 1.5)

<p>The cranks are levers that extend from the bottom bracket to the pedals, transferring pedaling force to the drivetrain.</p>

### Pedals (Refer to Figure 1.6)

<p>The pedals are platforms for the feet, attaching to the cranks and receiving pedaling force.</p>

### Chain and Gears (Refer to Figure 1.7)

<p>The chain and gear system (drivetrain) transmit power from the pedals to the rear wheel. Key components include:</p>

*   **Label:** Front Chain Ring
    **Description:** The large gear attached to the crank.
*   **Label:** Rear Freewheel (or Cassette)
    **Description:** The set of gears on the rear wheel.
*   **Label:** Front and Rear Derailleurs
    **Description:** Mechanisms that move the chain between gears.
*   **Label:** Shift Lever
    **Description:** Controls the derailleurs.
*   **Label:** Cables
    **Description:** Connect the shift lever to the derailleurs.

### Brakes (Refer to Figure 1.8)

<p>The brake system provides stopping power and includes:</p>

*   **Label:** Actuators (on Handlebars)
    **Description:** Levers operated by the rider.
*   **Label:** Brake Cable
    **Description:** Transmits force from the actuator to the brakes.
*   **Label:** Brake Calipers
    **Description:** Clamp onto the wheel rim or rotor.
*   **Label:** Brake Pads
    **Description:** Provide friction to slow or stop the wheel.
