## content

### Introduction

*   This data module describes the drivetrain of a bicycle.

### Drivetrain Components

#### Crankset

*   The crankset is the assembly that converts the rider's pedaling force into rotational force.

#### Cassette

*   The cassette is the set of sprockets on the rear wheel that provides different gear ratios.

#### Chain

*   The chain connects the crankset to the cassette and transfers power from the pedals to the rear wheel.

#### Derailleurs

*   Derailleurs are mechanisms that move the chain between different sprockets on the crankset and cassette.

### Maintenance

*   Regular maintenance is essential to keep the drivetrain in good working order.

#### Cleaning

*   The drivetrain should be cleaned regularly to remove dirt and grime.

#### Lubrication

*   The drivetrain should be lubricated regularly to reduce friction and wear.

#### Adjustment

*   The derailleurs should be adjusted regularly to ensure smooth shifting.
