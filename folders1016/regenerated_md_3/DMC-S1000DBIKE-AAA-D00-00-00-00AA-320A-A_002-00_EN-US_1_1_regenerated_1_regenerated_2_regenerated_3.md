# Bike Pre-Ride Check - Check List

This document details a pre-ride check list to ensure bicycle safety and proper functionality. Following these steps before each ride will minimize the risk of mechanical failure and enhance rider safety.

## Tool Equipment Required

*   `tool_equipment`: None (basic visual inspection &amp; manual checks)
*   `tool_equipment`: (Optional) Tire pressure gauge
*   `tool_equipment`: (Optional) Torque wrench (for fasteners - refer to component specifications)

## Step 1: General Condition

*   `number`: 1
*   `title`: General Condition
*   `action`: Check the overall condition of the bike before every ride.
*   `normal`: No immediate issues observed.
*   `abnormal`: Any visible damage or unusual wear.
*   `remedy`: Address any concerns before riding.

## Step 2: Fastener Check

*   `number`: 2
*   `title`: Fastener Check
*   `action`: Check all fasteners (bolts, nuts, quick releases) for tightness.
*   `normal`: All fasteners are secure and tight.
*   `abnormal`: Fasteners are loose.
*   `warning`: Incorrect tightening force can result in component failure, leading to loss of control.
*   `remedy`: Tighten and torque fastener according to specific maintenance instruction for the related component.

## Step 3: Bounce Test

*   `number`: 3
*   `title`: Bounce Test
*   `action`: Lift the front wheel off the ground 2-3 inches and bounce it on the ground.
*   `normal`: Nothing rattles or appears loose.
*   `abnormal`: Bike rattles or parts appear loose.
*   `remedy`: Secure the loose part according to the specific maintenance instruction for the related part.

## Step 4: Tire Pressure Check

*   `number`: 4
*   `title`: Tire Pressure Check
*   `action`: Check tire pressure.
*   `normal`: Tire pressure is correct according to the specification printed on the tire sidewall.
*   `abnormal`: Tire pressure is outside the specified range.
*   `high_pressure`: Bleed air from the tire until it reaches the maximum pressure printed on the sidewall.
*   `low_pressure`: Add air to the tire, not exceeding the maximum pressure printed on the sidewall.

## Step 5: Tire Inspection

*   `number`: 5
*   `title`: Tire Inspection
*   `action`: Inspect the tire for cuts or cracks.
*   `normal`: Tire has no cuts or cracks.
*   `abnormal`: Tire has visible damage.
*   `warning`: Riding on a damaged tire could cause tire failure, leading to loss of control.
*   `remedy`: Replace the tire before riding.

## Step 6: Wheel Trueness Check

*   `number`: 6
*   `title`: Wheel Trueness Check
*   `action`: Spin each wheel and observe for wobble.
*   `normal`: Wheels spin true without wobble.
*   `abnormal`: Wheels wobble when spinning.
*   `caution`: Wheels must be true for rim brakes to work effectively.
*   `remedy`: Have the bike serviced to true the wheels.

## Step 7: Rim Inspection

*   `number`: 7
*   `title`: Rim Inspection
*   `action`: Inspect tire rims for wear.
*   `normal`: No wear indicator marks are visible on the rim.
*   `abnormal`: Wear indicator marks are visible on the rim.
*   `warning`: Riding on a rim at the end of its life can result in wheel failure and loss of control.
*   `remedy`: Replace the wheel.

## Step 8: Brake Check

*   `number`: 8
*   `title`: Brake Check
*   `action`: Squeeze both brake levers.
*   `normal`: Front and rear brakes securely grip the wheel rim. Brake lever movement is within 1 inch.
*   `abnormal`:
    *   `condition`: Brakes do not close fully
    *   `remedy`: Tighten brakes according to maintenance procedure. Check/replace brake cables if necessary.
*   `abnormal`:
    *   `condition`: Brake lever movement exceeds 1 inch
    *   `remedy`: Tighten brakes according to maintenance procedure.
