## Learning Objectives

This learning plan details the development and implementation of a Basic Bike Awareness training program for couriers. The goal is to improve bike maintenance skills, reducing downtime and improving service reliability.

## Learning Plan Details

### 1. Content Overview

*   **Problem Statement:** Identifying the need for improved bike maintenance skills.
*   **Target Audience:** All bike couriers.
*   **Learning Objectives:** Detailed learning goals for the training.
*   **Curriculum:** A breakdown of the training modules.
*   **Instructional Methods:** The techniques used to deliver the training.
*   **Evaluation Methods:** How the effectiveness of the training will be measured.
*   **Implementation Plan:** A timeline and resource allocation for the training.

### 2. Problem Statement

Bike couriers often experience delays due to mechanical issues. This impacts delivery times and customer satisfaction. A lack of basic maintenance skills contributes to these issues. This training aims to address this gap.

### 3. Target Audience

*   All bike couriers within the organization.
*   Assumed skill level: Basic bike operation knowledge.

### 4. Curriculum

The training program will consist of a computer-based module combined with hands-on practice.

*   **Module 1: Introduction to Bike Maintenance**
    *   Overview of bike components
    *   Importance of regular maintenance
    *   Safety precautions
*   **Module 2: Steering System**
    *   Identifying steering system parts
    *   Installation and removal procedures
*   **Module 3: Braking System**
    *   Identifying braking system parts
    *   Inspection and adjustment procedures
*   **Module 4: Tire and Tube Maintenance**
    *   Identifying tire and tube types
    *   Repairing punctures
    *   Replacing tires and tubes
*   **Module 5: Chain and Gear Maintenance**
    *   Cleaning and lubricating the chain
    *   Adjusting gears
    *   Identifying worn parts

### 5. Instructional Methods

*   **Computer-Based Training (CBT):** Interactive modules with visuals, animations, and knowledge checks.
*   **Hands-on Practice:** Practical exercises where couriers apply what they've learned on actual bikes.
*   **Demonstrations:** Instructors will demonstrate key procedures.
*   **Q&A Sessions:** Opportunities for couriers to ask questions and receive clarification.

### 6. Evaluation Methods

*   **Formative Evaluation:**
    *   **Surveys:** Collect feedback on the training content and delivery methods.
*   **Summative Evaluation:**
    *   **Surveys:** Assess knowledge gained and confidence in performing maintenance tasks.
    *   **Assessment Results:** Evaluate performance on hands-on exercises.
*   **Performance Metrics (Post-Training):**
    *   Track reduction in bike downtime.
    *   Monitor improvement in on-time delivery rates.

### 7. Implementation Plan

*   **Phase 1: Content Development (2 weeks)**
    *   Create CBT modules.
    *   Develop hands-on exercise materials.
*   **Phase 2: Pilot Testing (1 week)**
    *   Conduct a pilot training session with a small group of couriers.
    *   Gather feedback and make necessary revisions.
*   **Phase 3: Full-Scale Training (4 weeks)**
    *   Deliver training to all couriers.
*   **Phase 4: Ongoing Evaluation (Ongoing)**
    *   Track performance metrics and gather feedback to continuously improve the training program.

### 8. Technical Requirements (CBT)

*   **Resolution:** 1024x768 recommended.
*   **Players/Plug-ins:** Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Acrobat Reader.
*   **File Size:** Optimized to minimize download times (under 100KB per file where possible).
*   **Graphics:** JPEGs and SWF files.
*   **Security:** Unclassified.
*   **Accessibility:** Consideration for accessibility standards.

### 9. Intervention Implementation

The intervention will be implemented through the creation and delivery of the combined CBT and hands-on training program.

### 10. Performance Evaluation

The effectiveness of the training will be evaluated using formative surveys, summative surveys, and analysis of performance metrics.
