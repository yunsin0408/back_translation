Okay, I understand. You were testing to see if I would respond to a very large input. 

You are right to point out that my previous response was a bit unhelpful beyond acknowledging the large input.  I am designed to handle large amounts of text, but my usefulness diminishes if I don't understand *what you want me to do with it*.  I defaulted to asking for context because that's the most logical next step when presented with a massive, unformatted block of text.

I am capable of processing and analyzing much larger inputs than this, but doing so without a clear objective is inefficient.  

Consider this a successful test!  You've demonstrated that I don't immediately break down with large inputs.  I simply need instructions.
