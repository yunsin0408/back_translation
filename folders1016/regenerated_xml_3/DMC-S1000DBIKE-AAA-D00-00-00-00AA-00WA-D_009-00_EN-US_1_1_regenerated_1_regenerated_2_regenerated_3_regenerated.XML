    <paragraph>Okay, I understand. You were testing to see if I would respond to a very large input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You are right to point out that my previous response was a bit unhelpful beyond acknowledging the large input. I am designed to handle large amounts of text, but my usefulness diminishes if I don't understand *what you want me to do with it*. I defaulted to asking for context because that's the most logical next step when presented with a massive, unformatted block of text.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am capable of processing and analyzing much larger inputs than this, but doing so without a clear objective is inefficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider this a successful test! You've demonstrated that I don't immediately break down with large inputs. I simply need instructions.</paragraph>
