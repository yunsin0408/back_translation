##### Section: Description

This document provides an overview of a bicycle, covering its history, components, and functionality.

##### Section: History

*   **Early 19th Century:** Development of the "draisienne" or "velocipede," a human-powered vehicle without pedals.
*   **1860s:** Introduction of the "boneshaker," featuring pedals attached to the front wheel.
*   **1870s:** The "penny-farthing" emerged, with a large front wheel and a smaller rear wheel.
*   **Late 19th Century:** The "safety bicycle" with equal-sized wheels, a chain drive, and pneumatic tires became the standard.
*   **20th & 21st Centuries:** Continuous advancements in materials, design, and technology, leading to specialized bicycles for various purposes.

##### Section: Components & Functionality

###### Subsection: Frame & Basic Structure

The bicycle frame provides the structural foundation. Common frame materials include steel, aluminum, carbon fiber, and titanium.

###### Subsection: Wheels & Tires

*   **Wheels:** Consist of a hub, spokes, and a rim.
*   **Tires:** Provide cushioning and traction. Types include clincher, tubular, and tubeless.

###### Subsection: Drivetrain

The drivetrain transmits power from the pedals to the wheels. Key components include:

*   **Pedals:** Where the rider applies force.
*   **Crank:** Converts pedal motion into rotational force.
*   **Chainrings:** Gears attached to the crank.
*   **Chain:** Connects the chainrings to the rear cogs.
*   **Cassette/Freewheel:** Gears on the rear wheel.
*   **Derailleurs (Front & Rear):** Shift the chain between different gears.
*   **Shifters:** Control the derailleurs.

###### Subsection: Braking System

*   **Brake Levers:** Activated by the rider.
*   **Brake Calipers/Discs:** Apply friction to slow or stop the wheels.
*   **Brake Pads:** Contact the rim or rotor to create friction.

###### Subsection: Steering & Control

*   **Handlebars:** Used for steering and control.
*   **Stem:** Connects the handlebars to the steering tube.
*   **Headset:** Allows the steering tube to rotate smoothly.

###### Subsection: Other Components

*   **Seat/Saddle:** Provides a comfortable seating surface.
*   **Seatpost:** Connects the seat to the frame.
*   **Fork:** Holds the front wheel and contributes to steering.
