You were previously asked to generate XML. The model's output failed validation.
Use the provided Knowledge Graph (KG) and the attached error log to produce a corrected, well-formed XML document.
Inputs available:
- KG (node/edge list) which you MUST consult for structure and nesting.
- The previously generated XML (PREVIOUS_XML).
- The parser error log (ERROR_LOG) describing syntactic problems.
Task:
- Return ONLY the corrected XML document. Do not include any explanation.
- Fix all syntax errors mentioned in ERROR_LOG.
- Ensure the output starts with '<?xml' and is well-formed.

ERROR_LOG:
Errors found:
Error 1: Line 1, Column 1: Start tag expected, '<' not found

PREVIOUS_XML:
I am sorry, but there is no XML content provided in the prompt. The prompt contains a table of data, not XML. I am unable to fulfill the request to return raw XML as there isn't any in the given input.  I can only work with the data that is provided to me.





Provide the corrected XML now.
